        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Bulbasaur using its vines to climb a tree Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pok\u00e9mon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. Small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis and from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within. First partner Pok\u00e9mon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers . Having been raised by humans from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pok\u00e9mon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pok\u00e9mon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pok\u00e9mon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a \"Bulba-by\". Its vines are long and strong enough to allow Bulbasaur to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries. Bulbasaur can survive for days without eating. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex , Bulbasaur is known to sleep in sunny spots. Bulbasaur has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sunbathing Sleep , Sturdy Sleep , Vines-Out Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep . It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region . However, due to Bulbasaur's status as first partner Pok\u00e9mon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy . A Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.

On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides, and it has narrow red eyes. Ivysaur has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a giant pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud. The weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming Evolution . Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Ivysaur is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if Ivysaur is awake or asleep during this process.

On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish-pink insides. It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a gynoecium in the center of its flower. Venusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pok\u00e9mon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day.  Venusaur is at its strongest in the summertime when there is much more sunlight to absorb. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Venusaur releases a soothing fragrance while sleeping. Venusaur has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sunbathing Sleep , Sturdy Sleep , Vines-Out Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: The Beginning episode Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden , Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead Evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur . This Pok\u00e9mon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit grasslands . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Gigantamax Venusaur using G-Max Vine Lash Venusaur has two forms: Mega Venusaur and Gigantamax Venusaur. Mega Venusaur When Mega Evolved , the flower on Venusaur's back grows more prominent, and two smaller pink flowers bloom, one on its forehead and one on its rear. Its legs and back have become sturdier to support the extra weight of the flower. Additional leaves with woody stems, supported by vines, are also grown around the flower. Mega Venusaur also develops dark markings on its forehead below the new flower on its forehead. Gigantamax Venusaur As Gigantamax Venusaur, it becomes larger with its flower blooming even further, covering its body. These flowers have a taller bud and extraordinarily thick, springy petals capable of shielding Gigantamax Venusaur. Its eyes have light green sclerae and orange irises. More foliage grows from under its flower, and the trunk supporting it becomes shorter. It has several light green markings located at its belly. Gigantamax Venusaur attacks with its thick vines, which are powerful enough to topple down a 10-story building. Gigantamax Venusaur's flower can similarly spread enough pollen to resemble a volcanic eruption. Breathing in this pollen can cause uncontrollable sneezing, and inhaling large amounts can even cause fainting. However, this pollen also promotes plant growth in areas where it lands. Gigantamax Venusaur is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Vine Lash .

A fire burns at the tip of this Pok\u00e9mon's slender tail, which has blazed there since Charmander's birth. The flame can indicate Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pok\u00e9mon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pok\u00e9mon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Charmander is known to sleep while curled up. Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, the sounds of its flame can be heard by listening carefully while Charmander sleeps. Charmander  has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Crackling Sleep , Tummy-Rub Sleep , Tummy-Up Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep . Charmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas .

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Charizard's tail flame burning blue after Professor Oak accidentally steps on its tail Charizard is a draconic , bipedal Pok\u00e9mon . It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. Two fangs are visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. In Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green , Charizard is seemingly shown holding a fireball, implying that it's capable of manipulating its flames using its hands; this is seen in media where it uses Fire Punch . It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated. Charizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys , such as the Charicific Valley in Johto . However, Charizard can also live in volcanoes, forming packs with other members of its family, including Charmander . In Pok\u00e9mon Snap , it's shown that Charizard are fully capable of living inside lava within volcanic craters. Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath can melt boulders and massive glaciers and has been known to cause forest fires accidentally. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Charizard's Burning Ambitions showed that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. The side story episode Those Darn Electabuzz! showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pok\u00e9mon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters), but An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS notes that its droppings were found on Mt. Fuji , implying it could fly thrice as high. In Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , as well as media like the animated series , Charizard is known to sleep in an incredibly relaxed position, as it is very confident in its power. Some Charizard are occasionally seen sleeping flat on their backs, which is potentially a sign that those Charizard are especially strong. Charizard has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Stomach Sleep , Tummy-Rub Sleep , Tummy-Up Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep . Charizard are apparently vulnerable to their tail flame going out in the same way as Charmander as evidenced by the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: The Beginning episode Charizard Chills where Ash warns his Charizard to not let its flame go out. Even though Charizard originally couldn't learn the move Fly , Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the 1997 Carddass Trading Cards . Ash himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the second season of the original series of Pok\u00e9mon the Series . Eventually, in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow , Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pok\u00e9mon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas. In Alola , Charizard is a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Charizard Glide, being used by the natives to fly around the region or make deliveries. Charizard Glide Forms [ edit | edit source ] Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y. Charizard has three alternate forms: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Gigantamax Charizard. Both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw. Mega Charizard X As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue consistently. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames. Mega Charizard Y As Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated from each other. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than that of a jet fighter. Mega Charizard X Mega Charizard Y Gigantamax Gigantamax Charizard's wingless body As Gigantamax Charizard, it becomes larger and more physically fit. The lower part of its body glows white, with several yellow diamonds on the lower belly. There are also diamond-shaped spots located on the front legs. The claws located on its hands and feet become longer and sharper. The feet become longer and digitigrade, retaining small glowing soles under the forefeet. The sclerae of the eyes become yellow. The glow of a flame can be seen in the mouth, and the teeth grow, with the lower front teeth and three teeth in the middle now protruding when the mouth is closed. The flame on the tail extends out and has three red clouds surrounding it, like the clouds most other Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon have. Two flames sprout from its horns, and its wings are transformed into literal flame wings extending to the shoulder blade. Due to being enhanced by Gigantamax energy, the fire within Charizard's body has become much stronger, burning hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius) and continuing to rise in temperature when Gigantamax Charizard roars. When using its signature G-Max Move , G-Max Wildfire , it launches its colossal fiery wings in the shape of a bird, which circles opponents while continuously scorching them with flames even hotter than magma.

While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl . It has large, purplish, or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves. Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pok\u00e9mon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes . Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap and Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise , Squirtle is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell. It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also occasionally rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping. Squirtle has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sheltered Sleep , Unsheltered Sleep , Overturned Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep .

On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail symbolizes longevity and good luck, making this Pok\u00e9mon popular with the elderly. Because it is larger than Squirtle and has a larger shell, Wartortle has a more difficult time walking on land and keeping its balance in the water. Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands.

Two powerful water cannons/jet nozzles reside at the top of its shell over its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail. The powerful cannons on this Pok\u00e9mon's back can produce water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and be used for high-speed charges. The speed of Blastoise's charges is similar to the force of a rocket. Blastoise makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and crush its opponents. It is shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle . Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes . Blastoise is capable of flying by propelling itself with water from the back openings of its shell. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell. Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions. This is due to Blastoise feeling completely secure in its surroundings and quickly falling asleep. Blastoise has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sheltered Sleep , Unsheltered Sleep , Overturned Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep . In Generation II , Blastoise and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Blastoise has two forms: Mega Blastoise and Gigantamax Blastoise. Mega Blastoise When Mega Evolved , Blastoise develops two smaller shells over its arms, each with its own water cannon. Small ridges develop over its now-red eyes and extend to its ears \u2014 which angle slightly backward \u2014 and there is a small point on its chin. The two cannons on its back merge into a single, central water cannon of greater size that extends forward over Mega Blastoise's head and can retract back into its shell. This main cannon has power equivalent to that of a tank gun at minimum and possesses a blast range of over 6 miles (10 kilometers). Mega Blastoise's strengthened legs and back enable it to withstand the recoil from its own blasts, but it can also use its arm cannons to further support itself by using moves such as Ice Beam to latch itself to the ground before firing a massive attack, such as during its Burst Attack in Pokk\u00e9n Tournament . Gigantamax Blastoise shooting streams of water from its cannons Gigantamax Blastoise As Gigantamax Blastoise, it becomes larger. Its eyes are white with bright blue sclerae. Its blue arms, head, and legs change to light blue, and the underside of its shell becomes dark red. Its shell becomes darker and transforms into a battleship-like formation, with 31 cannons of different sizes: sets of twin cannons emerge from hexagon and rectangle-shaped holes within the shell, and a main cannon protrudes from the center. Several white triangular spots are located on its tail and legs. Three red clouds surround the main cannon. Gigantamax Blastoise can adapt to any situation using various cannon combinations. It is not very good at precision shooting, so instead of aiming its attacks, it prefers to overwhelm its opponent by launching dynamic, powerful torrents from its cannons. According to one legend, its main cannon is so staggeringly powerful it can blast holes through the mountains. Gigantamax Blastoise can also individually align the 12 cannons surrounding its main cannon to attack in any direction.

Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of its legs resemble small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation . Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male. The wings of Butterfree are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. Using this powder, it will defend Caterpie from bird Pok\u00e9mon. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross , as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Sappy Ending . Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles , but it also observed in the episode Bye Bye Butterfree flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Butterfree is known to sleep while flapping its wings. It tends to accidentally scatter highly toxic dust while sleeping. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Butterfree has a Gigantamax Form. As Gigantamax Butterfree, its wings become shades of bright and dark green with a white pattern. A fur-like circle attaches to Gigantamax Butterfree's back at the base of the wings. Its antennae also become bright green and extend to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround them. Its eyes glow bright red. Several green scales, created from crystallized Gigantamax energy, can be seen floating around Gigantamax Butterfree. These are its most effective weapons, capable of causing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. Gigantamax Butterfree scatters these scales by the winds that it generates with each flap of its wings; these winds are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck.

Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Like most rodents, its teeth grow continuously throughout its life and must be worn down by gnawing. This also ensures that Rattata is not awoken by the sound of its grinding teeth while sleeping. Females will have shorter whiskers. Rattata can live wherever it can find food, which it searches for most of the day. Thanks to its sharp fangs, it is able to chew on nearly anything. When it is threatened, Rattata can deliver a powerful bite. Rattata constantly keep their ears up and will immediately scurry away from the slightest sound. Furret is the natural predator of Rattata.

There are two tufts of fur on each ear and near the tip of its tail. Its long, thin whiskers are also replaced by shorter, thicker tufts of fur. The line where its cream underbelly meets its gray fur is ragged instead of smooth. Unlike its Kantonian form, it often stands on its hind legs, giving it a more bipedal appearance. Rattata are non-native to Alola and arrived in cargo ships. The Rattata population in Alola was booming until Yungoos and Gumshoos were imported as a control measure. In order to avoid these new predators, Rattata altered its habits. It moved to more urban areas, became nocturnal, and formed large nests led by Raticate . Each nest has an Alolan Raticate serving as their boss. Alolan Rattata searches out fresh food by smell and ignores anything spoiled. The whiskers provide Alolan Rattata with a keen sense of smell, allowing it to find hidden food instantly. Humans are known to use Alolan Rattata when they go shopping for fresh food. Alolan Rattata are more active when the sun sets. Alolan Rattata will search for food in order to give to their boss. It has even been known to sneak into people's homes to find food.

It is selective in what it eats, however, only eating fresh, high-quality foods, such as fruits. Rumor has it that a certain high-class restaurant even exploits this selectivity, bringing Raticate along to buy ingredients and letting it taste test new dishes. Each Alolan Raticate has its own territory, and disputes over food and feeding grounds happen frequently. Alolan Raticate and Rattata are not native to Alola, having been brought to the region via cargo ships.

Raichu is covered in dark orange fur with a white belly. Its bifurcated ears are brown on the outside, yellow on the insides, and end in a distinctive curl. There is a circular yellow marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end. This lightning bolt is chipped on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from its body and glows slightly in the dark. Raichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It also protects Raichu from its high-voltage power. Raichu can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out a Copperajah . If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up, and its muscles will become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress. To prevent it from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground. This leads to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of Evolution via Evolution stone , Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and woodlands . The main reason Raichu is rarely seen with Pok\u00e9mon trainers is because people prefer the look it had as Pikachu . As revealed in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Electric Shock Showdown , Raichu is not capable of learning speed attacks upon evolving and can only learn them when they're still Pikachu. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Raichu is known to sleep while discharging electricity, and a long tail is planted into the ground like a rod. It can electrocute anyone who comes near it while sleeping. Raichu and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle .

In Alola , Raichu has lighter coloring and more rounded features. Its eyes are blue with yellow half-circles along the bottom. It has large yellow ears with an inner spiral toward the base and brown on the inside. These ears are thicker and less pointed than a standard Raichu's ear. In addition to its white belly, Alolan Raichu has white markings on its paws with bright yellow lines between its digits. The stripes on its back have also turned white, and there is a small, white circular marking on each heel. The lightning bolt-shaped tip of its tail has rounded edges. By collecting its psychic power in its tail, it can ride it like a surfboard and float in the air. While its cheek sacs are still used to store electricity, rubbing them releases a sweet aroma while also getting a light shock. This is also thought to be connected to its Psychic abilities. Alolan Raichu's origins were initially a mystery at the time. The people of Alola suggested it ate too many sweet and fluffy pancakes, especially those made with a secret Alolan recipe. However, researchers believe the change is related to Alolan Raichu's diet in general. It is also believed the weather and climate of the Alola region played a role in the transformation. Alolan Raichu is capable of unleashing star-shaped thunderbolts. It is also known by the name hodad . While normally found in Alola , it has been seen in the Coastal Biome of the Terarium during rare mass outbreak events .

Its brick-patterned yellow hide is dry and tough, blends in with desert sand, and protects its soft white underbelly and muzzle. Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides. Its tail is thick and conical. It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow. Sandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows. It only emerges to lunge and drag in passing Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon. Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents but may also throw sand at attackers. While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the desert , Sandshrew has been found in caves as well. It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels. Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano. It is also known to bathe in sand, which helps remove dirt and moisture from its body. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Concept artwork of Alolan Sandshrew for Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon Sandshrew has a regional form : Alolan Sandshrew. In the Alola region, Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains due to the volcanic activity near the desert areas. Its body is a light, icy blue, with a cream-colored belly and muzzle. Thicker plates form a dome around its head, and its ears resemble an igloo 's entrances. Adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier, with a shell of hard ice covering its hide. The shell is also made of very hard steel. This steel-like covering grants it extra defense from predators like Sneasel , but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart; smarter predators such as Weavile exploit its soft underbelly. Alolan Sandshrew can burrow itself in the snow to avoid being blown away by blizzards. Its claws allow it to move without slipping on icy surfaces, but it slides on its stomach when it needs to move quickly. A traditional Alolan custom during festivals is a competition to see who can slide Alolan Sandshrew across the ice the farthest.

Its back is mostly covered in sharp, brown quills from its tough, dry hide. It has two large claws on its paws and feet. These claws are its primary weapons and are used for slashing, but can also be used for burrowing. Its claws and spikes can both break off, but they grow back quickly and are shed regularly. Sandslash's broken parts can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields. The claws can become harder and smoother if they live in drier areas. Sandslash can curl into a large ball, which allows it to roll to attack or escape, protect itself from heatstroke, and guard its belly. Sandslash is also adept at climbing trees and is prone to ambush its enemies from above. It also climbs trees to rest during the night and to slash Berries to feed the Sandshrew waiting below. Sandslash is mostly found in deserts . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Sandslash has a regional form : Alolan Sandslash. In the Alola region , Sandslash has an icy blue hide and steel quills covered in ice. These quills stand taller than a regular Sandslash's quills and resemble icicles. Unlike its Kantonian variant, Alolan Sandslash is rarely seen curling up into a ball, perhaps made difficult by its thick hide and icy spine. Instead, this Pok\u00e9mon uses its hide for camouflage in the snow while exposing only its spines. Its body emits cold air, which sharpens its quills. Its forepaws are larger than its counterpart, and its claws are longer, thinner, and hooked at the tips. Formerly used for climbing trees, they now allow it to scale icebergs without slipping. Despite the weight of its ice-covered body, Alolan Sandslash can move swiftly by carving a path in the snow with its claws. It can move faster than any other Pok\u00e9mon while in the snowy mountains. This Pok\u00e9mon tends to live in the deeper parts of snowy mountains, where climbing is forbidden. However, the sprays of snow it kicks up are popular shots for photographers. People also climb up the mountains it lives in, to see Sandslash's icy spikes sparkle during the light of dawn.

It has a small mane of thicker fur around its neck and a long, fluffy crest atop its head. It has slender legs with three-toed paws and nine long tails with pale orange tips. It has red eyes, pointed ears, and a triangular black nose. A legend claims that Ninetales is the reincarnation of 9 united noble saints. While intelligent enough to easily understand human speech, Ninetales is a vengeful Pok\u00e9mon known to curse those who mistreat it. Ninetales will also curse anyone who wakes it up by grabbing one of its many tails. The curse can last up to 1,000 years.  As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team , once a Ninetales casts its curse, it cannot be removed even by Ninetales itself. It can live for 1,000 years due to the energy within its nine tails, each of which is said to have a different mystical power. Flames spewed from its mouth can hypnotize an opponent and its gleaming red eyes are said to give it the ability to control minds. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Ninetales is known to sleep while wrapped inside its tails, giving it a mystical appearance. In the first Pok\u00e9mon movie , it's shown that it can swim. Pok\u00e9mon-Amie shows that Ninetales lick their paws to clean themselves. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone , Ninetales are rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grasslands . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Ninetales has a regional form : Alolan Ninetales. In the Alola region, Ninetales have a different appearance. Its coat is pale blue, and its fur is more flowing and wispier. The tips of its tails and crest and the lower halves of its legs are white. The crest on its head is longer, and its nine tails are less distinct. Additionally, it has larger blue eyes and small tufts of fur in front of its ears. Alolan Ninetales lives on Alola's snow-capped Mount Lanakila , which some consider holy ground. As such, it is revered as a sacred messenger or deity. Alolan Ninetales has a gentle and calm temperament and is known to aid lost humans in distress, though this is primarily done to keep them out of its territory. It will punish any threat to its pack of Vulpix . Those who anger it will be frozen stiff in an instant. It can produce ice crystals from its fur, which it can use for both offense and defense. The ice crystals can act as a shield or form balls that can be fired like bullets with enough force to shatter rock. They can also be found in the Polar Biome of Blueberry Academy 's Terarium , where Alola's island life is simulated.

Jigglypuff can use its eyes to mesmerize opponents. It has a large lung capacity, exceeding most other Pok\u00e9mon. Once it has an opponent's attention, Jigglypuff will inflate its lungs and sing a soothing and mysterious lullaby. This melody can cause anyone who listens to become sleepy. If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its life by continuing to sing until it runs out of air. It will continue to sing until the opponent is asleep. It can adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep. This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents. Its vocal range exceeds 12 octaves, but its skill depends on the individual. Its song varies by region, and it sounds like shouting in some areas.

Golbat's fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. There are some Golbat that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon. Golbat feeds on the blood of both Pok\u00e9mon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting.

Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs. While the games almost always depict Meowth on two legs, it is stated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Go West Young Meowth that Meowth normally walks on all fours. Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using its signature move , Pay Day . Meowth and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow , with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pok\u00e9mon with the capacity for human-like intelligence, with at least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Meowth is known to sleep with the coins it collects. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Meowth has a Gigantamax form and two regional forms , Alolan Meowth and Galarian Meowth. Alolan Meowth In Alola , Meowth has a slightly different look. This look was the result of the monarchy's influence. Alolan Meowth's fur is a light blue-gray color. Instead of brown markings, the tip of its tail, whiskers, digits, and the insides of its ears a whitish-gray. Alolan Meowth's whiskers have a slight curve compared to regular Meowth's straighter whiskers, and it has silvery eyes. Meowth was introduced to Alola as a gift to royalty. The luxurious royal lifestyle soon led to Meowth diverging from its origins and becoming the selfish, prideful, and cunning Alolan Meowth. As a result, Alolan Mewoth's new pride also made them impulsive and fickle in nature. Alolan Meowth will turn hysterical if its coin or pride are besmirched. Due to the actions of humans in Alola, Alolan Meowth's population increased in numbers. When the monarchy fell, the rare Alolan Meowth went feral and eventually grew as common in Alola as anywhere else. Alolan Meowth is known to be very famously diffcult to train due to their arrogant nature. Despite this, Alolan Meowth is also very popular with some Trainers who enjoy giving it a lot of attention. Galarian Meowth Galarian Meowth has a shaggy, greyish-brown coat resembling a beard, as well as yellow eyes and a toothy grin. Its coin is now black and extremely hard, with the darkest and hardest coins being especially valued and respected among the species. Galarian Meowth's body has partially turned to iron as a result of many years of living with a race of savage seafarers. As a result of many battles, Galarian Meowth develops the ability to evolve into Perrserker , instead of Persian . Kantonian Meowth and Galarian Meowth don't get along. Gigantamax Meowth Some Kantonian Meowth are capable of Gigantamaxing. As Gigantamax Meowth, it has become larger and longer in size. The body extends from the lower half to the shoulder, while the gold coin gains a symbol. Meowth's eyes change to a glowing gold color. The tail grows long as well, with the end of its tip extending. The tail gets even larger and bumpy when it uses an attack. Three red clouds surround it below the shoulders. The giant coin on Gigantamax Meowth's head emits a lot of Gigantamax power that surrounds the area with a golden gleam. Its desire for shiny objects increases to the point where it will cause damage to skyscraper windows and exterior walls for the sake of sharpening its claws. The symbol on Gigantamax Meowth's gold coin is believed to be the key to unlocking the secrets of Dynamax .

        "name": "Persian",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Persian is a large, quadrupedal, feline Pok\u00e9mon . Its fur is pale tan with the exception of its black-rimmed ears. It has a short muzzle with a small, black nose, red eyes with slit pupils, rounded ears, a pair of pointed teeth in its upper jaw, and three whiskers on either side of its face. Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long tail has a distinctive curl at the end. Persian communicates with body language and holds its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound. Persian normally lives in towns and cities . Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with Perrserker is one of mutual disdain, as Persian's refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Persian is known to clean and groom itself even when asleep. Even when asleep, Persian maintains its striking and haughty expression. Persian and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Persian has a regional form : Alolan Persian. Alolan Persian has a body that is similar to its regular counterpart, but it has blue-gray fur. Its appearance is due to the luxurious lifestyle it received from the past Alolan monarchy. Its face has a different shape, being larger and more rounded with noticeable jowls. Its eyes are usually in a half-closed state, and instead of a red forehead jewel, it has a blue jewel. The jewel, though different in appearance, is made of mostly the same material as the one on a regular Persian. Alolan Persian's distinctive face, along with its high-class softer-than-velvet fur coat, is admired by the people and Pok\u00e9mon of Alola. Alolan Persian's face is seen as a symbol of great wealth. Additionally, Alolan Persian is considered to be a Pok\u00e9mon of great beauty. The bigger and plumper an Alolan Persian's face is, the more beautiful it is considered. The rippling of Alolan Persian's fur in battle is said to have a beauty of its own. This has made Alolan Persian a very popular Pok\u00e9mon in the Alola region. Due to its distinctive fame, Alolan Persian is well protected and cared for by the Alola region. Notably, strict inspections are required before tourists are granted permission to take one Alolan Persian to their home region. In behavior, it is described as highly intelligent and having an even higher opinion of itself. This prideful Pok\u00e9mon looks down on everything other than itself. Alolan Persian is a very difficult Pok\u00e9mon partner to use in battle. The reason is due to it being unwilling to bond with its Trainer. Alolan Persian is said to have formidable physical abilities in battle. While battling, Alolan Persian puts on a refined act at first. However, it prefers to use underhanded tactics in battle. These tactics usually consist of surprise attacks to blindside foes, trickery, and even foul play like sucker punches. Because of these brutal tactics, it prefers to torture its weakened prey rather than finishing them off. This haughty personality has often caused it to underestimate opponents and be deceived by their counterattacks.

Its legs and tail are stubby, and it has cream-colored webbed feet. There are three claws on each of its hands. Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache and is unable to think very clearly. It usually stands immobile, trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, Psyduck releases tension in the form of strong psychic powers. The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in sleepers, and the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to recall these episodes. Psyduck lives in freshwater lakes and small ponds, but can be seen in rivers in tropical areas as shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Psyduck suffers headaches while it sleeps. Very rarely, their sights are Psyduck sleeping peacefully while not holding its head.

Its hands and feet all have three clawed digits with cream-colored webbing in between. Its body is specially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer. Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for Golduck, the Kappa due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet. Golduck is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pok\u00e9mon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The TCG depicts Golduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pok\u00e9mon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pok\u00e9mon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes , where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim Golduck punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Golduck is known to paddle its webbed limbs while sleeping. It is believed Golduck is dreaming about swimming.

Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown. Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains , where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated. According to the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts . However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell.

Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles. This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights. The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes. Primeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When it becomes enraged, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. Primeape also possesses the ability to convert its anger into energy to attack its opponents with. It has sturdy vessels in its brain that keep it healthy despite its constant anger. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught up to its target. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Pok\u00e9 Ball . In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new .

Its mane covers its eyes and extends below its head, ending with three curls. Its ears are round and square with light orange-red interiors. It has a small horn made of rock on its head, and its tail is curly. Growlithe's Hisuian form is the result of it being exposed to volcanic activity within the coastal highlands it lives in during Hisui's early times. Hisuian Growlithe's soft and insulated fur allows it to survive the cold weather of Hisui. Although Hisuian Growlithe's horn is made of rock, it is fragile and breaks easily, so the Pok\u00e9mon rarely uses its horn unless needed.

It has two long, pointed ears on top of its head, a red star on its forehead, narrow, deep-set eyes, and wide cheeks leading down to a thin snout. Extending from each side of its snout are two mustache-like tufts of fur; a male will have a longer mustache than a female. Kadabra's torso is segmented with bulky shoulders, a thick, brown chest, and a small abdomen marked by three red, wavy lines. Attached to the Pok\u00e9mon's abdomen is a large, thick tail encircled with a brown band near its base. Its arms are thin with brown elbows and end in three-fingered hands with white claws. Its legs have prominent knees and large, three-toed feet, also ending in white claws. Two of its toes face forward and one backward. Kadabra is always seen carrying a silver spoon, which amplifies its telekinetic powers. A gold spoon does not work as an amplifier and Kadabra is only half as strong without a spoon. Kadabra emits alpha waves strong enough to induce headaches, and can even cause clocks to run backward, machines to malfunction, and delicate devices to cease functioning altogether. The waves increase further in strength the more danger Kadabra faces. By closing its eyes, it can double the number of alpha particles it emits. When it has a headache, the alpha waves become unusual. All of Kadabra's brain cells work in unison while it uses its powers. It sleeps while levitating, using its springy tail like a pillow. It can store up psychic energy inside its star in preparation for its Evolution. There is a theory that Kadabra was born from a transformed human child who could not control his powers.

Covering its yellow, skeletal body are brown armor-like sections over its chest, shoulders, forearms, and knees. There are three toes on each foot, each of which has a white claw. Two of the toes face forward, while one faces backwards. It wields a silver spoon in each hand, which act as amplifiers for its psychic abilities. The spoons are created using its psychic powers and it may give one to someone it trusts. According to its Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Moon Pok\u00e9dex entry, anything eaten with the spoon becomes delicious. Alakazam is able to use all forms of psychic abilities, including telekinesis and blasts of offensive energy . The overflow of its psychic powers can cause headaches to those nearby. These powers are used to move its body, as opposed to its weak muscles. It also uses its psychic powers to hold up its head, which is too heavy to be supported by its neck. Due to its continually growing brain, its head becomes larger with age. It is said to have an excellent memory and can remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra , to the time of its death, and has an IQ that exceeds 5,000.

The ear-like spikes become slightly shorter and a larger spike forms on top of its head. Additionally, it gains an oval, red organ in the center of its forehead. The organ is said to emit psychic power. Its lower legs become longer and slimmer and its feet become skinnier and resemble talons. It gains three additional spoons, for a total of five that it levitates in the air. At the cost of its already-low muscular strength, Mega Alakazam's power is entirely converted to pure psychic energy. Mega Alakazam is constantly floating thanks to its psychic powers. It can read the course of a person's entire life with a single glance. Mega Alakazam's red organ allows it to foresee every move an opponent makes and everything else.

It was shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap that, despite having legs, it can revert to a legless form. This grants it the ability to float. Graveler's preferred locomotion is rolling, specifically, because it is a slow walker. It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds exceeding 60 mph, crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks should it build up too much speed. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river instead. Graveler is known to be generally free and uncaring, not minding if pieces of itself break off, as it can restore itself over time. Graveler climbs a mountain from base to summit, feasting on rocks all the while. Graveler's favorite rock to eat is moss-covered rocks. It regularly consumes tons of moss-covered rocks and makes loud noises while eating. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls down to the bottom. Graveler live in horizontal holes that they gouge out in sheer cliff faces , and they are capable of withstanding volcanic temperatures.

Alolan Graveler feeds on dravite , which creates the yellow crystals on its body and grants it electrical abilities. It often fights with others over food, and when two smash together, it creates a flash of light and a booming sound; for this reason, people refer to it as \"the fireworks of the earth\". Similar to its Kantonian counterpart, Alolan Graveler rolls down mountain paths; however, instead of flattening obstacles as it rolls, it sends them flying by zapping them with electricity.

It has short arms that have three claws and two legs with feet that have four claws in front and one in back. The head and limbs are light brown. Golem grows bigger by shedding its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens when exposed to air, crumbling away and returning to the soil. Farmers are known to collect Golem's shells. Golem's soil is spread across fields to promote crop growth. However, it stops shedding with age and moss grows over its shell. As shown in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards , Golem's shell is hollow, despite it looking like it is not. As shown in The Bridge Bike Gang , Golem can withdraw its head and limbs into its shell and roll at high speeds. It is dangerous when doing this, as it is unable to see and may crash into or run over anything in its path. To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild. However, it can be found living in mountainous regions. Golem are known to detonate their own body. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain.

The cannon prevents them from easily rolling into a ball like its Kantonian variant. Alolan Golem has a grumpy and stubborn personality. Should anyone make Alolan Golem upset, it will roar with a voice similar to thunder, discharging electricity from its body at the same time. Alolan Golem is capable of firing the small rock by using magnetism. The rock will be electrically charged, creating shocks across the whole area of impact. Numbness and fainting can occur with even a glancing blow. If rocks are not available, it will fire nearby Geodude instead.

        "name": "Ponyta",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Ponyta is an equine Pok\u00e9mon with cream-colored fur that resembles a foal/filly. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames make up its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be ten times harder than diamonds and act as shock absorbers. Ponyta are relatively lightweight for their size, as they have extraordinary jumping abilities and are capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents and jumping over grass that grows taller by the day. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Flame Pok\u00e9mon-athon! , it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them, and Ponyta only does this for those that it has accepted. Ponyta herds tend to live in grasslands , plains, mountains, or anywhere that they can run freely. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Ponyta has a regional form : Galarian Ponyta. Ponyta has adapted in the forests of the Galar region, after generations of being exposed to the life energy found within. Galarian Ponyta has chalk-white fur covering most of its body. Instead of flames, its mane, tail and fetlocks are covered in a long, purple-and-blue, fluffy fur. Its eyes are purple with light-blue irises, and it has a small purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead. Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use. Galarian Ponyta's horn has healing powers; it can heal any slight wound with a few rubs from its horn. By looking into the eyes of a person, Galarian Ponyta can read the contents of their heart. Should it find any evil, it will promptly go into hiding. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode The Tale of You and Glimwood Tangle! , Galarian Ponyta can send pleas for help in the form of visions to people, even if they're from another region.

It has small, red eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames stream from the back of its head to form a long, flowing mane. A short version of the mane trails down its back to its equally fiery tail. Flames are also present on its fetlocks . It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof. Rapidash is a very agile Pok\u00e9mon. It runs at about 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature that is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash is capable of traveling an entire region like Hisui within a day and a half. Rapidash lives in grasslands , but it can also be seen on mountains in Pok\u00e9mon Snap . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Rapidash has a regional form : Galarian Rapidash. In Galar , Rapidash takes on a new form with a white coat, pale blue eyes, and a long, curly mane and tail colored in streaks of pastel cyan and pink. Its horn is much longer than that of Kantonian Rapidash and is deep violet in color with a spiraling white line running its length. Its fetlocks are adorned with long pink fur that stores psychic energy, which gives it a swift, airy gait, and it has deep violet hooves. When using psychic energy, its horn glows with a yellow aura, and its colored fur glows with seemly flowing color. Galarian Rapidash lives in forests and is known for being brave and prideful.

        "name": "Slowpoke",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Slowpoke is a pink Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus . It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. Slowpoke tails are considered a delicacy and commonly used as a cooking ingredient: in Alola , they are often dried and used in home-cooked stews, while in Galar , they are smoked and packaged as a curry ingredient. Slowpoke is also known to dive underwater to hunt, but is often itself caught instead. Slowpoke has a notoriously dim intellect and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water's edge . In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain. This Pok\u00e9mon is worshiped in those areas. Its vacant expression is said to help some people relax, whilst causing irritation to others. It is posited that those who lead hectic lives are most likely to become relaxed. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , researchers have debated if Slowpoke is either awake or asleep while it stands around doing nothing. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Slowpoke has a regional form: Galarian Slowpoke. Galarian Slowpoke's body is a slightly different shade of pink, and it has gained yellow colorations on its forehead and tail. This tail is always down and is said to have a spicy taste. Galarian Slowpoke's diet consists of eating spices. Much like its Kantonian counterpart, Galarian Slowpoke is known to relax on seashores and riverbanks without a care in the world. However, sometimes it will get a very sharp look in its eyes as if it is about to think of something tremendous, although it will quickly forget and return to its normal expression afterward. It is believed that this behavior, along with the spicy taste of its tail, is a result of Galarica particles built up from its diet of native Galarica seeds affecting its brain and body. This diet also affects Slowpoke's two different Evolutions, including the Shellder that attaches to it, which is induced by either the Galarica Cuff or the Galarica Wreath . Due to the scent of the spice emanating from its tail, the Galarian Slowpoke often has difficulties while fishing. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy 's Terarium , where Galar's regional life is simulated.

        "name": "Slowbro",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Slowbro is a bipedal, pink Pok\u00e9mon with a tan, striped belly and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has large, vacant eyes, curled ears, and two small pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers on its hands and two clawed toes on its feet. There is a Shellder attached to its tail. This Shellder has a gray, spiral shell with darker gray spots and small, triangular eyes near the base. There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth. Shellder developed its spiral form in an effort to suck more sweetness out of Slowbro's tail. If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, Slowbro will revert to its unevolved form, Slowpoke . Slowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison. While typically lazy and unintelligent, Slowbro apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, Slowbro is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps. Slowbro tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Slowbro usually sleeps at the same time Shellder bites its tail. On occasion, Slowbro sleeps even when Shellder is still awake. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Slowbro has a regional form , Galarian Slowbro, and can Mega Evolve into Mega Slowbro. Galarian Slowbro In Galar , Slowbro's appearance differs due to Shellder biting its arm instead of its tail, causing a chemical reaction between the Shellder's poison and the consumed Galarica spices within the Slowpoke's body. The Shellder attached to its arm resembles the Shellder tail of its Kantonian counterpart, but is smaller, with a purple tip shaped like a stinger, and lacking visible pupils. Galarian Slowbro itself has a slight color difference compared to its counterpart, being pinker, with purple accents on its head, arms, and tail. Galarian Slowbro is considered highly dangerous for its tendency to indiscriminately attack its surroundings, the reason for which is due to its Shellder sometimes unconsciously biting down hard on its arm. Another reason is that Shellder feels bliss when biting hard enough to absorb Galarian Slowbro's poison. However, Shellder will occasionally faint from the seeping poison, and Galarian Slowbro occasionally lashes out due to the itching caused by said poison. While normally zoned out, when facing a strong opponent its body becomes stimulated, and it will sport a sharper expression. Galarian Slowbro attacks by grabbing at its Shellder's tongue, causing the Shellder to fire poisonous liquids from its tip. It attacks at speeds rivaling the quickest of known reflexes. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy 's Terarium , where Galar's regional life is simulated. Galarian Slowbro is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shell Side Arm . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Quick Draw as an Ability . Mega Slowbro As Mega Slowbro, it becomes engulfed by the Shellder so that only its head, arms, and white-tipped tail are visible. Its head pokes out of the Shellder's mouth and is surrounded by the Shellder's enlarged teeth. The Shellder has holes on its sides and an opening at its tip, allowing Mega Slowbro's arms and tail to stick out. Mega Slowbro balances on its tail due to its legs being engulfed. It can move by bouncing, using its tail as a spring. The spikes on the Shellder are now reduced to four on the bottom section of its body and the dark spare dots are only visible on its middle section. Mega Slowbro's energy has gathered into Shellder, which has increased its hardness. This allows it to act as armor so hard that nothing can scratch it. The Slowbro inside is virtually unchanged, but it gains some power and motivation from Shellder's digestive fluids.

        "name": "Magnemite",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Magnemite is a seemingly robotic Pok\u00e9mon that has a gray, spherical metal body, with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pok\u00e9dex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Get Along, Little Pok\u00e9mon that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman , it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph . It has also been present in AZ 's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. The magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman , it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again. Magnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pok\u00e9tch . In the episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite , it is shown to be attracted to electric Pok\u00e9mon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets. There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping.

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Magneton splitting into three Magnemite Magneton is a robot-like Pok\u00e9mon , the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when there are no other Magnemite in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pok\u00e9mon Snap , the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6\u00a0\u00b0F (2\u00a0\u00b0C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area. Magneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman , food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain , often near power plants . When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series episode The Future I Choose , it can cause interference with phone and internet signals. In An Unexpected Picnic! , a herd of Magneton produced an EMP that could destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph . One was shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Generations episode The Redemption in a flashback to the great war of Kalos , indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force. It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps. Evolution [ edit | edit source ] Magneton evolves from Magnemite and evolves into Magnezone .

It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead (similar to a unibrow ), and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail. Farfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex , Farfetch'd will always hold onto its stalk, even when sleeping on its back in a defenseless position. Farfetch'd has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sprawled Sleep , Plant-Stalk-at-the-Ready Sleep , Plant-Stalk-Nibbling Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep . Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as Pok\u00e9mon the Series and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia , its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food ; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the Pikachu short Pikachu's Vacation , Farfetch'd are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks. Farfetch'd and Sirfetch'd are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Leek item. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Farfetch'd has a regional form : Galarian Farfetch'd. In Galar , Farfetch'd is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head and a much more unfriendly look on its face. The leek it carries with its wings is much larger in Galar than the leeks that Farfetch'd use in other regions, although whether it is related to the Large Leek used as a curry ingredient is unknown. Galarian Farfetch'd's body has developed a much stronger frame that gives it the strength required to carry its leek. However, this sheer mass makes it hard for it to fly. It is renowned for its courage in battle and can use its leek like swords or javelins. As a result of surviving and experiencing many different battles, Galarian Farfetch'd develops the ability to evolve into Sirfetch'd .

It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination. Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is usually awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync. Due to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner.

It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking. Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains , even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo , Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up.

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Grimer is a slimy, amorphous Pok\u00e9mon , born from sludge in dirty streams or seabeds that are exposed to lunar radiation. It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue. While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand. Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Should it run out of internal germs, Grimer will die. Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new Grimer. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds. Due to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is Grimer's main diet. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found. In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, Grimer is now facing extinction. Prior to Generation IV , Grimer and its evolved form, Muk , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stench as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Grimer has a regional form : Alolan Grimer. Grimer was brought to Alola to deal with the excess waste generated by the region's increased population. Alolan Grimer eats solid garbage instead of sludge; this new diet has caused its body composition and form to change. Alolan Grimer's body is green with a line of yellow sludge along its lower lip that extends around behind its head, a bright blue tongue, and small black crescent-shaped spaces behind its eyes. It also has two blunt \"teeth\" in its upper jaw, which are actually crystallized toxins formed by its diet. It is not known how to break down these toxic crystals, but direct contact with them is known to be dangerous. Lethal poisons leak out of Alolan Grimer's body when these crystals fall out. Because it produces and stores toxins within its body, Alolan Grimer does not produce a foul stench like Kantonian Grimer. There are usually about one hundred Alolan Grimer found living near waste-disposal sites in Alola, assisting people in dealing with garbage. Alolan Grimer is widely used and a very popular Pok\u00e9mon used in garbage disposal facilities around the world. Alolan Grimer is perpetually hungry and must constantly eat trash. If no trash is readily available, it will eat other manufactured products instead. In addition to garbage, Alolan Grimer preys on Trubbish and Garbodor ; its introduction to Alola caused their populations to decrease in the region. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy 's Terarium , where Alola's island life is simulated.

        "name": "Muk",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Muk is a large, sticky, amorphous Pok\u00e9mon made of living purple sludge. It has two small eyes with beady black pupils. It also has an enormous mouth with a gray tongue and strands of ooze connecting its top and bottom jaws. While it has no visible legs, it does have two arms with three fingers on each hand. However, it typically keeps one hand tucked in while it extends the other hand. Muk is a living biohazard, leaking toxins that instantly kill all plant life it touches. Even it being in close proximity to plants will cause them to wilt and die. Extreme caution is advised in avoiding any contact with this Pok\u00e9mon, as an accidental brush-up can lead to severe sickness. The effects of this Pok\u00e9mon can leave the landscape barren for three years. It will readily consume nearly any waste or refuse generated by people and Pok\u00e9mon alike. Muk's body produces a powerful odor that can cause fainting. However, despite the risk Muk's stench contains, some fans of Muk believe its stench is a good thing. Muk can be found in heavily polluted bodies of water, factories and cities , where groups can gather to consume trash that people throw away into the streets. However, Muk's population has declined due to recent environmental improvements and extermination efforts. This has led some to believe that it will go extinct at some point; sludge ponds are being built to prevent its extinction. Prior to Generation IV , Muk and its pre-evolved form, Grimer, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stench as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Muk has a regional form : Alolan Muk. Alolan Muk has a more vibrant coloration, consisting of green, pink, and yellow stripes with thin blue bands in between. The green, yellow, and pink stripes are capable of shifting downwards while the blue stays in place. It has various white, crystallized poison shards protruding from parts of its body, especially from its mouth and fingers, giving the impression of claws and fangs. It has blue eyes with a black space behind them and a bright blue tongue. Its vivid coloration is a result of the garbage it eats, which causes chemical changes in its body. Its body contains over a hundred different kinds of poisons. Chemical reactions of different poisons occurring within its body is the source of Alolan Muk's vitality. Alolan Muk is unexpectedly quiet and friendly. However, if it is not fed trash for a while, its hunger will compel it to destroy its Trainer's furnishings for food. It is thought that it cannot maintain its energy without a constant source of toxins, which causes its voracious appetite. The crystals covering its body have a tendency to break off, which makes it extremely difficult to deal with due to the concentrated toxins contained within them. Unlike Kantonian Muk, Alolan Muk does not produce a foul stench due to its toxins being contained within its body. Alolan Muk preys on Trubbish and Garbodor . They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy 's Terarium , where Alola's island life is simulated.

        "name": "Shellder",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Shellder is a bivalve mollusk Pok\u00e9mon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its long, red tongue, usually hidden due to the darkness of Shellder\u2019s body, extends from its often closed mouth. Shellder uses this tongue to burrow into the sand to sleep overnight and to lure and capture prey. If it were to close its shell, nothing could come to it; however, the tongue protrudes even when its shell is shut. Tugging on it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pok\u00e9mon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock , the two will instead evolve into Slowking . These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar , Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths , causing the Evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. Shellder that are part of Slowbro change in shape further if it Mega Evolves. Regardless of which form the two Pok\u00e9mon evolve into, Shellder's shell changes to a light gray color with irregular darker spots. Its shape changes into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers, which is slightly rounded for Galarian Slowbro. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder has a large horn on either side of its shell, which is purple for Galarian Slowking. It also gains a gem: a red one on the underside for Johtonian Slowking, and a green one between its eyes for the Galarian form. As part of Mega Slowbro, it becomes large enough to contain most of the Slowpoke's body, gaining two holes near the rim and an opening at the tip, through which protrude the Slowpoke's forelegs and tail respectively. While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pok\u00e9mon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! and An Evolution in Taste! , the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its host. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar , whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon . Kingler , Rufflet , and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder. Prior to Generation III , Clamp was its signature move . Prior to Generation V , Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding . Additionally, prior to Generation V, Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Skill Link as an Ability .

It is encased inside a light-gray shell, which is surrounded by a second jagged, blue-violet outer shell casing. It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell. Its shell is harder than a diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside. This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike. Cloyster typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent. However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed. With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled. The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming. It swallows seawater and then ejects it towards the rear, pushing it through with siphon-jet propulsion. Being the result of Shellder evolving through an Evolution stone , Cloyster is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found on the sea floor , nestled among the rocks and coral; however, it will actively hunt on land for Slowpoke tails. Cloyster and its pre-evolved form, Shellder , are relatives of Gastrodon . Kingler is a natural predator of Cloyster. In Generation I , Clamp was its signature move .

However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pok\u00e9mon surrounded by a purple haze. Gastly has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them. It produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. Gastly's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Tower of Terror suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, in the episode A Shipful of Shivers , it shows a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It is also shown in The Ghost of Maiden's Peak changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. Gastly can be found within caves and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind. It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Gastly is known to sleep while floating.

Disembodied hands with three clawed fingers each float in front of its body. Its body tapers into a jagged tail. Haunter's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. Haunter hides in very dark places, such as caves , and is afraid of light. If a human or a Pok\u00e9mon comes near Haunter, it will stalk the victim while floating and beckon it to come closer. Once approached it will then lick the victim with its gaseous tongue, inflicting convulsions in the victim that last until death. It can also float through walls.

Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail. Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar's body acts as a heat sink . Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10\u00a0\u00b0F (5\u00a0\u00b0C), because it absorbs the warmth.

The spikes on Mega Gengar's back are more numerous and pointed, and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward. Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no interest in opponents unless perceived as prey.

Because of its resemblance to Pok\u00e9 Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. This is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally. Voltorb is generally found in power plants and other areas with electric fields where it feeds. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Pok\u00e9 Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if agitated or bumped by the slightest contact. Due to being constantly mistaken as a Pok\u00e9 Ball , Voltorb has reportedly zapped many humans as a result. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Voltorb has a regional form : Hisuian Voltorb.

On the inside, Hisuian Voltorb's body contains numerous seeds, but it has been impossible to examine its interior due to it being pitch-black. Hisuian Voltorb has a distinctive red wooden unibrow. Despite its resemblance to a Pok\u00e9 Ball, it can be inferred that Hisuian Voltorb's existence predates the device's invention, as evidenced by the fact that the ancient hero of Hisui legend had an Electrode companion which would become the ancestor of the region's noble Electrode. Hisuian Voltorb can store electric currents in its belly, which it discharges all at once from its hole. Unlike Kantonian Voltorb, Hisuian Voltorb have friendly and excitable temperaments, which leads them to cluster around people, causing them to be a nuisance when they discharge. It is known to let out a great, uproarious laugh whenever it discharges. There are stories of people temporarily plugging the holes of Hisuian Voltorb to prevent them from discharging before removing them from their settlements.

Its top half is white, while its lower half is red. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Electrode as hollow. Electrode tends to live in power plants where fresh electricity is being generated, which it consumes. As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy Electrode consumes, the faster it moves. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind. Electrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. However, unlike Voltorb, Electrode can control its explosive ability at will. This unpredictable and explosive nature has earned it the nickname of \"Bomb Ball\". Because of its appearance, many Trainers try to pick Electrode up, mistaking it for an item. As seen in the anime, if Electrode explode to defend themselves, this also results in them using up their energy and becoming extremely worn out. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Electrode has a regional form : Hisuian Electrode. In Hisui , Electrode also resembles an upside-down Pok\u00e9 Ball, specifically one of its time period, with a wooden upper half and a glossy, dark red lower half with a hole in the bottom. Its eyes are large black holes inside a debossed pattern, resembling an angry glare. Its mouth is in a constant frown, unlike its Kantonian counterpart's smile, giving the impression that it is drawn on. Interestingly, its surface texture is similar to that of an Apricorn . When enraged, Hisuian Electrode can unleash an electric current equivalent to about twenty lightning bolts. It can absorb and store chlorophyll energy along with electricity. Electrode can release this energy through the hole on its lower half. It can also climb up trees. A special Hisuian Electrode is worshipped by the Hisui people due to it being descended from one of the ten ancient Pok\u00e9mon who received a blessing from Arceus despite the fact that Pok\u00e9 Balls had not yet been invented.

Its body and legs are light brown with thin black rings and its legs are thick with two-toed feet. There is a light yellow paw pad on each foot's underside. It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions. Exeggutor's heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups together with others to become an Exeggcute . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: The Beginning episode The March of the Exeggutor Squad , Exeggutor also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pok\u00e9mon. Exeggutor has been referred to as \"The Walking Tropical Rainforest\" or \"The Walking Jungle\". It can be sluggish during cloudy days due to the lack of sunlight.

The region is considered to be the best environment for Alolan Exeggutor. Alolan Exeggutor's neck is thinner and much longer, causing it to more closely resemble a coconut tree or tropical palm tree than its Kantonian counterpart, which resembles the shorter desert palm. It has a long, tapering tail with two leaves and a fourth light green head on the tip. This extra head can also act on its own and defend the rear. The tail can use weak telepathy to scan the surrounding area. Its long neck can be used as a whip to attack enemies with its hard head. However, its neck can also be a weak point, as it will become dizzy swinging it around. Its increased height reduced its need for a psychic defense and has instead awakened its draconic powers, resulting in its psychic powers becoming weaker. Ancient carvings and murals depict this Pok\u00e9mon. Alolan Exeggutor is considered the pride of the Alola region by its natives. Alolans take pride in its appearance, claiming this is what Exeggutor ought to look like. Its extra height makes it the tallest and heaviest Grass-type . Alolan Exeggutor can be found on Exeggutor Island , a former trial site in Alola, which is not only shaped like an Exeggutor, but contains many wild Exeggutor, giving the island its name.

Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black (sometimes green or blue) eyes and a small area surrounding them, and in its Bandai Namco card a bit of its mouth, where it has a pair of a few sharp teeth and a long pink tongue. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. This small Pok\u00e9mon survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon. It is called the Lonely Pok\u00e9mon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its Marowak mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits \"a plaintive and mournful sound.\" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize a likeness of its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz , its natural predator, who uses this Pok\u00e9mon's bones to decorate itself and its nest. It is said a Cubone will evolve into a Marowak once it comes to terms with the pain of its mother's death. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Cubone is known to cry while sleeping. It is theorized that Cubone's dreams are about its deceased mother. The dreams Cubone have make it cry, but crying makes it stronger. Cubone lives in rocky areas, usually on mountains or in caves.

Marowak's head is composed of the skull it once wore as a mask. It can no longer remove the skull, which has become part of its body. The skull has two pointed spikes on the back similar to ears and tiny nostrils on the tip of the snout. Marowak's triangular, brown eyes are also located in the skull. Marowak is well known for its ferocity with its bone club, which it is said to collect from a hidden graveyard. Despite its small size, Marowak's body is as sturdy as armor . Upon evolution, Marowak has overcome the grief of its mother's passing. Now ferocious and violent, Marowak is an adept combatant that uses the bone it carries as a weapon and a boomerang. Having evolved, it seeks vengeance on its natural enemy Mandibuzz , which prey on Cubone because of its naturally weak and timid demeanor. Marowak has also been recorded pounding on boulders with the bone club it carries to tap out messages to others. It lives in mountains to test its skills. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Marowak is known to sleep while using its bone similar to a pillow, possibly being at peace.

This harsh environment led it to bond closely with its friends, which is said to have created a sort of sixth sense and caused it to take a new form. Alolan Marowak's body is black and it has pale gray eyes. There is a dark, flamelike mark on its skull between the eyes. Compared to regular Marowak's squatter, thicker body, Alolan Marowak is relatively thin. White markings resembling shoulder blades, vertebrae, and hip bones are visible on its back. The bone Alolan Marowak uses is longer than the one regular Marowak uses. It customarily mourns its companions by burying them and dancing in mourning. Alolan Marowak rubs the bone it wields against its forehead to light the ends in a green flame and then twirls the flaming bone. The flame is made from spirit of its deceased mother. The deceased mother has transformed into vengeful spirit that will protect Alolan Marowak. It specializes in an attack where it releases a weak ball of flame from its bone that will relentlessly pursue its foe. Alolans would fear it for a conjurer, due to its rarity and the fearful sight of it dancing with its bone. The dance is also used as a way of mourning for its lost allies. Once its flames have spread onto an opponent, they are impossible to put out with water. The cursed flames are known to cause both mental and physical pain.

Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart. Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular Hitmonlee can do this with its arms as well). The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that Hitmonlee can fully control. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, Hitmonlee will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Kick Master\".

The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare. Each of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level. Weezing lives in urban areas .

It does not care if obstacles get in the way, merely smashing through them or sending them flying, although it may feel pain the day after a collision. This personality is how Rhyorn expands its territory. Rhyhorn is powerful enough to shatter skyscrapers or mountains instantly after charging forward with head tackles.

There is a row of spikes down its back and they have a long tail with thin, black stripes. Rhydon is a physically powerful Pok\u00e9mon. It is recorded as being able to topple buildings with a sweeping blow of its tail, and its horn can bore through solid rock and shatter diamonds. Rhydon sharpens their horns by clashing them together. Its armor-like hide protects it from heat and physical blows. It is stated to be capable of passing unscathed through streams of magma (3,600 degrees Fahrenheit) and withstanding a direct blow from a cannonball without being harmed. However, because of this tough hide, it is insensitive. Despite its well-developed brain, it can be forgetful. Rhydon lives in rough terrain like in caves or on top of mountains.

On top of its head is a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally and it has triangular eyes. Capable of seeing color to some degree, Pinsir appears to be attracted to the color green. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward. Pinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents; lift things twice its weight; and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. Pinsir's horns are quite flexible as depicted in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards where they have a wide range of motion. In addition to hunting prey, it's shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Sappy Ending that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles , where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Pinsir burrows itself into the ground to sleep during cold nights but its pincers can be seen sticking out of the ground as it slumbers. In Alola , it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross . Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers. The pincers determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how more thick and impressive it looks. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Pinsir can Mega Evolve into Mega Pinsir. As Mega Pinsir, it gains a large pair of clear, yellow wings with an area of orange venation near the base. Additionally, a set of brown elytra appear. Slicing through each elytron is a pair of orange blades. Its arms become longer and it has a T-shaped spike on each forearm. The pincers on its head are now longer with larger spikes, and its eyes are now yellow. When it Mega Evolves, Pinsir is left in a constant state of excitement. It rarely touches the ground due to its ability to now fly. Mega Pinsir can travel up to approximately 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h) and uses its two large horns to pierce its enemies before shredding them. Mega Pinsir can lift opponents up to 10 times heavier than itself with its horns and still fly around easily. Mega Pinsir"

It has a hump on its shoulders, a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, small, triangular eyes, three gray bumps running vertically down its forehead, and a pair of curved, gray horns growing from atop its head. Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species. Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pok\u00e9mon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. Tauros are capable of smashing through large boulders when charging. It lives and travels in herds on plains and grasslands . It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns. While still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in Alola than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. It is believed that the practice of using Tauros as Ride Pok\u00e9mon , which is done to this day, originated in Alola. In contrast, Tauros in Galar are more volatile and don't like to be ridden. Tauros is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Raging Bull . Forms [ edit | edit source ] In Paldea , Tauros has three separate regional forms : Combat Breed, Blaze Breed, and Aqua Breed. All three forms of Paldean Tauros are covered in dark gray fur, and have a thick black mane, gray horns, black hooves, and dark gray tails with black tips. Each form also has three gray bumps running vertically on its forehead, increasing in size from top to bottom. The physical differences between the three forms are visible on the shapes of their horns, manes, and tails. The three forms of Paldean Tauros are known as \"The Wild Bulls of Paldea\". Combat Breed The Combat Breed of Paldean Tauros has short, rounded, almost straight horns, and its mane and tails are shaped similarly to Kantonian Tauros. Combat Breed Paldean Tauros is known for its thick, powerful muscles and aggressive nature. Thanks to its muscular body, it is skilled at close-quarters combat, able to use its horns to strike at an opponent's weak spots. Blaze Breed The Blaze Breed of Paldean Tauros has sharp horns, pointing forward and bent at right angles. Its mane is spiky with streaks of red, and its tails are intertwined. Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros earns its name from the hot air it breathes from its nostrils. When channeling its fire energy, the bumps and horns on Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros's head will glow red. The horns can reach a temperature of over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius), causing anyone gored by them to suffer both wounds and burns. Aqua Breed The Aqua Breed of Paldean Tauros has horns that usually point upward but can rotate backward \u2014 each horn has two round, bulbous forms and a hole on its tip. Its mane flows downward and is shaped like a beard, with five teardrop-shaped blue accents on it. Its tails are usually straight, but can bend to form a propeller shape, which aids it in swimming. Aqua Breed Paldean Tauros is recognized for its high body fat, which allows it to float easily in the water. It swims by unleashing high-pressure jets of water from its horns, as well as using its tails to propel itself. It can use the same water jets to pierce right through any enemy it hits. The bumps and horns on Aqua Breed Paldean Tauros's head will glow light blue when it attacks.

It has large, vacant eyes and pink lips. Its pectoral and tail fins are white. On its back is a stiff, three-peaked yellow fin, resembling a crown; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long barbels . The barbels are white on a female and pale-yellow on a male. A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species. Magikarp is found in many bodies of water , such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I , Splash was its signature move . It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot . Frillish is also known to prey on Magikarp. In Hoppy Town , there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished. The people in Hoppy Town train their Magikarp to jump the highest in order to compete in a series of Leagues to win prizes. Evolution [ edit | edit source ] Magikarp evolves into Gyarados .

It is mostly blue with a yellow underbelly, and it has a row of yellow spots down each side. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four pointed teeth and yellow lips. It has one pair of barbel and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and blue on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky dorsal fins . Gyarados's tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points. The process of Evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, Gyarados is called the \"deity of destruction\" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A Gyarados's rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a Gyarados appear. Gyarados lives in both fresh and salty waters . Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in Pok\u00e9mon Chronicles and Pok\u00e9mon the Series that it can leap huge distances both from the water and from the ground , usually several times its own body length. However, Gyarados is rarely seen in the wild. The move Hyper Beam is often associated with Gyarados due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Gyarados can Mega Evolve into Mega Gyarados. When it Mega Evolves, Gyarados becomes bulkier. The fins on its cheeks become longer and gain a yellow tint. Its crest is larger and black, and its barbels also gain considerable length. A large spike extends downward underneath its chin, and it now has a black underside with a red stripe around the edges. The yellow spots along its body are replaced by raised red scales, which propel Mega Gyarados through the water. Two large yellow fins with blue spines appear on its back. Most of the other fins along its back disappear, replaced by two rows of blue spikes. There are now four yellowish, spiky fins near its tail: two on its back and two on its underside. Due the stress Mega Evolution puts on a Gyarados's body, it becomes even more ferocious and rough-tempered than before. All other brain functions cease when Mega Evolution occurs, except for the destructive drive to burn down anything into cinders. Despite its brain having a powerful destructive instinct, it will obey a Trainer it truly trusts. Mega Gyarados can launch at Mach Speed by using its orifices to release water from both sides. With this speed, it has enough power to split large ships in two. Mega Gyarados is tied with Hoopa Unbound as the tallest Dark-type .

It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its \"head\", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod -like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile. Ditto bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pok\u00e9mon. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and abilities. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pok\u00e9mon at once. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Ditto's Mysterious Mansion , as well as in the TCG and some spin-off games , it is shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face during transformation; a trait that has become synonymous with the species despite being incongruous with their depiction in core series games. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind, which it will quickly (and generally fruitlessly) attempt to transform into. It is shown to be able to transform into humans as well; however, it cannot mimic human speech. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid being attacked. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Ditto is known to sleep while still transformed into either a rock or Pok\u00e9mon.

The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns . It is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving . Eevee can potentially evolve into eight different Evolutions . Eevee can also start to adopt the face of the Trainer that owns it. Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon Evolution. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Eevee is believed to dream about which form it will evolve into. Eevee is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Extreme Evoboost . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Eevee has two forms: the partner Eevee and Gigantamax Eevee. Partner Eevee [ edit | edit source ] The partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements were likely taken from Pok\u00e9mon the Series , which implemented similar traits starting in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire . The partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. The white tip on a female partner Eevee 's tail has larger, rounder scallops than other Eevee. Before Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield , this trait was unique and wasn't found on other female Eevee. Since Sword and Shield, however, the unique tail pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference . As a result, Pok\u00e9mon GO was updated to apply this change to all female Eevee as well.

Gigantamax Eevee [ edit | edit source ] As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds circling it. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and more luxurious, any enemies caught in it will become enamored and lose the will to fight. Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious after Gigantamaxing, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.

It was created in 1995 by Silph Co. , but documents at Silph Co. claim it was created at the Pok\u00e9mon Lab on Cinnabar Island using the state-of-the-art technology of its time. Because it was created decades ago, many of its parts have since become obsolete. It was the first artificial Pok\u00e9mon to have ever been created through computer programming. In ancient Hisui , people were confused about Porygon and its Evolutions due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time. Due to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given.

Only its four short, yellow legs and a second pair of luminescent red eyes are visible on its underside. In its original time, Kabuto was prominently found on beaches , likely aided by its fast and powerful swimming ability.

There is a ridge down its back with three flat spines on either side and it has a flat, pointed tail. Instead of hands, its forearms have large, sharp, gray scythes. Its thin legs are brown lead to small feet with two large gray claws. Before it went extinct, Kabutops was in the process of evolving into a land dweller as evident by changes in its gills and legs. This change is thought to be due to its prey moving onto land as well. In its ocean home Kabutops could tuck up its limbs to help it swim extremely fast, up to roughly 29 knots. It used its sharp scythes to slice enemies and drink their internal fluids. Any leftovers left behind by Kabutops are consumed by other Pok\u00e9mon. It is unknown what led to Kabutops's extinction.

It has small sharply pointed ears, narrow dark green eyes, a ridged snout, a gaping mouth, and a strong lower jaw full of serrated fangs. Its body is covered in light blue-gray skin and it has large, violet membranous wings. The clawed hands at the end of each wing allow it to grasp objects. There is a hump-like ridge with a spike on its back, and it has a strong tail with an arrow-shaped tip. Its talon-like feet have two toes in front and one in the back, and are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight. Aerodactyl's serrated saw-like fangs and ferocious attitude were very imposing in its time. Its fangs can rip out throats and tear through the skin of any Pok\u00e9mon to pieces, even Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon. By spreading its wings, Aerodactyl is believed to have flown by gliding through the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However, it is slow to walk on land. It liked to nest in the mountains , where it enjoyed both safety and seclusion. Aerodactyl lived in prehistoric times, and was theorized to become extinct thanks to a giant meteor impact. It was restored in modern times using genetic material extracted from amber; some casualties occurred during these attempts. Even still, this restoration is not considered perfect. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Aerodactyl can Mega Evolve into Mega Aerodactyl. As Mega Aerodactyl, its eyes turn bright green and parts of its body turn to stone, which some researchers believe to be its original appearance before fossilization. It grows larger and sprouts jagged black spiky rocks all over its body: five spikes at the wrist joint of each wing replacing its hands, three small spikes along its tail, one spike on each ear, and a long spike on its chin. The spike on its back and its rear talons have also become black and stony. Rocky plates cover its eyebrows and the corners of its jaw. Similar stone ornaments are present on its chest on its torso: two small ridges flanking a longer ridge. The power of Mega Evolution allows some of Aerodactyl's dormant genes to reawaken. Some scholars claim that Mega Aerodactyl is Aerodactyl's true appearance from prehistory before it was revived. Some of the rocks on Mega Aerodactyl's body are harder than diamond. Because of the burden of Mega Evolution, Mega Aerodactyl is fiercer and more irritable than before. As a result, Mega Aerodactyl attacks anything that moves. Mega Aerodactyl"

(399-400\u00a0kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber, although it can also eat while it is resting. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. Once a Snorlax enters its slumber, it is almost impossible to wake it up. A Pok\u00e9 Flute is one of the few things that can awaken Snorlax from its slumber. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk 's poison. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pok\u00e9mon bounce on its large stomach. Despite its apparent laziness, however, Snorlax can exhibit tremendous power when prompted.

Its long, streamer-like tail is longer than its body and the same shade of blue as its crest. Its appearance is so beautiful that, as stated in An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS , those who see it will die rooted to the spot. Articuno has the power to control ice at will. In The Power of One , its ice is said to have formed the ocean's cradle alongside Moltres 's fire, and it has some connection to the weather patterns of the Orange Islands . When Articuno flaps its wings, it can chill the moisture in the air around it, making snow fall. It flies from icy mountain to icy mountain. According to legend, it appears before doomed travelers lost in icy regions. As seen in Freeze Frame , Articuno sometimes aids travelers and guides them to safety. Articuno lives in cold, isolated locations such as snowy mountains filled with permafrost. It is also shown to be territorial in The Power of One , immediately moving to conquer the territories of Moltres and Zapdos in their absences, and fighting among them thereafter.

Its body is primarily gray with a long, purple tail and a large purple underbelly. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb. According to journals found in Kanto 's Pok\u00e9mon Mansion , after discovering the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Mr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon of all. It was held and studied in the mansion, where it acquired extreme power and a vicious disposition after enduring horrific gene-splicing experiments. It eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pok\u00e9mon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes . Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in dark caves somewhere. In Mewtwo Strikes Back , Mewtwo was shown to be capable of levitation, mind control, memory erasure, telepathy, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. As shown in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu , Mewtwo can also transfer a human 's soul into a Pok\u00e9mon's body provided that said Pok\u00e9mon is in a crazed state, causing this person to gain control of the Pok\u00e9mon's body and abilities. It possesses a rivalry with Mew . As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened , Mewtwo can breathe in outer space. In the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, Mewtwo 's creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew 's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells were used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist Blaine . Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life. Mewtwo is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Psystrike . Shadow Mewtwo A unique variant of Mewtwo, called Shadow Mewtwo , is very similar to standard Mewtwo, but with dark gray skin, a dark gray tail with a yellowish orange tip, and a shard of Shadow Synergy Stone coming out of its shoulder. In the past, Anne was almost possessed by a Shadow Synergy Stone but was saved by Mewtwo, whom the Shadow Synergy Stone took control of and merged with instead. Under the stone's influence, Shadow Mewtwo travelled around Ferrum , draining Gaia Power from other normal Synergy Stones , which continuously increases its power. Shadow Mewtwo Forms [ edit | edit source ] Mewtwo has two forms. Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y. Additionally, Shadow Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into Mega Shadow Mewtwo X by using Synergy Burst . Mega Mewtwo X Mega Mewtwo X stretching its arm. Mega Mewtwo X is larger and bulkier than its normal state. The horns on its head are longer and extend from V-shaped ridges on its forehead. Additionally, the horns are now pointed and curve upward. It now has two tubes behind its neck, its eyes are light blue, and it has large, purple growths over its shoulders. Its torso is smooth and small compared to its long, bulky limbs, and a Y-shaped line connects the collar and underbelly. Its forearms and thighs each have two raised ridges and its digits are now longer and thinner. Its tail is slightly shorter and stiffer than before and has a curled tip. Due to the Mega Evolution, Mega Mewtwo X's physical power received a formidable growth. Its muscles are augmented with psychic power, giving it a grip strength of one ton and the ability to sprint 100 meters in two seconds. When using moves in battle, it is shown to be able to stretch its arms and legs. Mega Shadow Mewtwo X Mega Shadow Mewtwo X greatly resembles its normal counterpart, though it maintains its dark gray coloring due to the influence of the Shadow Synergy Stone. The glowing yellow-orange of the stone's infection is no longer confined to its tail, spreading to both of its shoulder growths, its arm ridges, and the tips of its ears. Additionally, the Y-shaped line running across its body (now including its legs) glows the same yellowish-orange color. Like its counterpart, Mega Shadow Mewtwo X can stretch its arms and legs. This unique form is achieved when Shadow Mewtwo uses both Shadow Synergy Burst and collected Gaia Power build up. The transformation can be undone if Shadow Synergy Stone is separated from Mewtwo. Mega Mewtwo Y Mega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail, underbelly, and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail and also slightly resembles Jessie's hairstyle. On its head, it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to the base of each and crossing over the top of its head. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous and the middle toe is longer than the others. A bumpy ridge similar to a sternum replaces the breastplate structure on its chest, but this form is still largely smoother than the other two. Despite its decreased size, it has phenomenal mental power and is capable of smashing buildings with a mere thought. Mega Mewtwo Y stays constantly in the air due to its smaller size and increased power.

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Mew is a pink, bipedal Pok\u00e9mon with mammalian features. It has a rounded, wide snout; triangular ears; and large, blue eyes. It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope. Mew has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. It is said to have the DNA of every single Pok\u00e9mon contained within its body. This causes many scientists to theorize that Mew is the ancestor of all Pok\u00e9mon . It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known moves , regardless of their types . It has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pok\u00e9mon . It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink. According to journals found in Kanto 's Pok\u00e9mon Mansion , Mr. Fuji is the one who discovered Mew deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of Mew's DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Mewtwo . Since Mew can make itself invisible, very few people have seen it , leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it. According to the Pok\u00e9mon the Series -related radio drama, The Birth of Mewtwo , Mew was discovered by Jessie 's mother, Miyamoto , who registered its cry in a forest 20 years before the events of the series. It was worshiped for its protection by ancient people who created a song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met Mew by sunrise on the peak of a high mountain. As depicted in the episode In the Palms of our Hands! it is capable of splitting itself up and transforming into more than one Pok\u00e9mon at the same time. It was also shown to possess a strong rivalry with its clone, Mewtwo in Mewtwo Strikes Back . Mew is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Genesis Supernova ."

Sudowoodo is very weak to water and hates it, so whenever it starts to rain, it will break their disguise and flee to the nearest source of shelter. Because it holds its position for so long, its arms have become supple yet strong. It is popular with the elderly, with available magazines and fans devoted to its arm angle and length. Sudowoodo can be found living in forests , sometimes sharing a habitat with Trevenant . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Sudowoodo is known to keep its tree mimicry even when sleeping.

Wooper lives in cold water most of the time. When sleeping, it partially buries itself in the mud at the bottom. It will occasionally leave the water when the air cools in the evening to search for food along the shore. While walking on land, it coats its body with a slimy, toxic film that keeps its skin from dehydrating and insulates against the cold. The film causes a shooting pain if touched barehanded.

Wooper in the Paldea region has a brown coloration, with two pairs of bone-shaped gills branching from its head, as well as an eight-pronged pattern on its stomach. Paldean Wooper once lived in the water during ancient times until they were forced out of their territory. As a result, they gradually adapted to living on land, namely in marshes. Paldean Wooper employs two adaptations to allow it to survive on land: its gills have hardened, and it coats its body with a poisonous film that keeps it from drying out. However, these adaptations resulted in Paldean Wooper having heavy bodies and being only able to move really slowly. To defend itself, Paldean Wooper can use its gills to unleash a powerful poisonous liquid. Paldean Wooper travel and work together in groups of three or four, and enlist the help of their evolutionary relative, Clodsire , to ferry them across water.

In the Japanese version of Pok\u00e9mon Crystal , a researcher implies that the Unown began appearing at the Ruins of Alph after the Pok\u00e9mon Communication Center was built in Goldenrod City . This text was translated and left unused in the English release. The Pok\u00e9dex , Unown Report , and Professor Oak 's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves (specifically radio waves) or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pok\u00e9gear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute . Unown has an unknown connection to Arceus . It is said that an \"odd power\" emerges when more than one Unown come together. Certain Unown loose in the Hisui region were capable of repelling Pok\u00e9 Balls that contained Pok\u00e9mon, preventing them from being battled . Professor Laventon 's research observed that Unown resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the Pok\u00e9mon movie Spell of the Unown: Entei , Unown is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown. Unown is an extremely rare Pok\u00e9mon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pok\u00e9mon world , Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other Unown, usually in ruins . In Pok\u00e9mon Crystal, the Unown are said to share a cooperative bond with Suicune . In Generation VIII , Unown is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Hidden Power . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Unown has 28 separate forms, all referred to as \"One form\". Pok\u00e9dex 3D Pro , the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game , and other supplemental materials such as official guidebooks refer to each form by the letter or symbol they represent.

There are two eyespots on its black tail. Its eyespots are revealed to be capable of blinking and looking around using its tail in the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium series . Wobbuffet is very protective of its tail, supposedly due to the belief that said tail hides a secret about Wobbuffet, to the point where it will suddenly turn uncharacteristically aggressive if the tail is attacked. Wobbuffet is usually a docile Pok\u00e9mon that will never attack first. However, when it is attacked, it will inflate its body and initiate a counter-strike. When two or more of this Pok\u00e9mon meet, they will attempt to outlast each other in a battle of endurance.

Heracross has oval, yellow eyes. Its forearms have a pair of spikes near the wrists, while its thighs have a single spike each. It has two claws on its hands, and a single long claw on each foot. There is a single pair of wings covered by elytra , which can be seen during its release from a Pok\u00e9 Ball in the 3D games. Heracross's claws allow it to dig into the ground for sturdy footing and also allow it to climb trees. Using its horn, it throws opponents or competitors for food. It can lift and throw objects 100 times its own weight. It uses its two antennae to search for food by scent. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Heracross is known to occasionaly sleep while licking the sap it finds.

Sneasel is a smart, sneaky, and notoriously vicious Pok\u00e9mon, and blends well into the night in order to ambush their prey. Sneasel feeds on Eggs , such as those of Pidgey , that it steals from unattended nests. It uses its claws to poke a hole in the Egg before slurping the contents out. It has been known to form pairs to hunt: one Sneasel will lure the parents away from their nest, while the other steals their Eggs. Although the Sneasel pair works together, they will also fight over their hunt among themselves.

Remoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy , out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet (100 meters) away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, Remoraid is referred to as the \"sniper of the seas.\" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward. Remoraid tends to travel by attaching to Mantine 's fins or in large groups of its own kind. It attaches itself by using its dorsal fin, which acts like a suction pad.

As it is not worried about surroundings even in its sleep, Tyranitar can be seen sleeping in an amazing sleeping position with its limbs open wide. As a result, Tyranitar is always looking for a battle and will not flinch at anything, though it ignores opponents that it thinks are not worth its time. Tyranitar's power is so devastating that it can forcefully crush anything using one of its hands. If enraged, Tyranitar sets off outstanding earthquakes that can completely change the entire landscape, destroying houses and mountains, and often forcing cartographers to draw up new maps. It lives in nests made from demolished mountains . In the Galar region , it has a fierce rivalry with Duraludon , which it shares its habitat with, often battling each other in the mountains. Iron Thorns is believed to be a relative of Tyranitar from one billion years in the future. Prior to Generation IV , Tyranitar was the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Sand Stream as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Tyranitar can Mega Evolve into Mega Tyranitar. Mega Tyranitar has more gaps in its armor than its normal form, with four new triangular holes along the sides of its neck and one on its throat. The four holes on its chest are now larger with the top two containing red ovals. While the spikes along the back of its neck grow shorter, the ones on its head elongate to form prominent ridges along its brows. The center spike on its head becomes a long, upright horn. Its chest plate expands, curving over its shoulders and along its back to form three long, irregular spikes on each side of its body. The scales on Mega Tyranitar's belly have now become red instead of blue and seethe with energy, enabling it to emanate more power. It gains two sharp spikes on its knees, as well as more prominent leg joints. Its tail lengthens, with the three spikes surrounding its tip growing upward and outward. Its back had split open because of the overwhelming power from Mega Evolution.

Their known habitat stretches the entirety of Galar, being found in fields, forests, and towns. They enjoy battling to the point where they often attempt to provoke others into fighting them.

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Linoone is a slender-bodied, quadrupedal Pok\u00e9mon . Most of its fur is colored tan, but it has several brown stripes. One long stripe stretches the length of its body before ending in an arrowhead shape on its forehead. There are additional stripes on each side of its bushy tail and on its cheeks. It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes. Linoone can run up to 60 miles per hour , but it can only run in a straight line, and has to stop before it can make a turn. Because of this behavior, it often fails to catch prey, and struggles on roads that are curving or winding. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its razor-sharp claws to catch and take it down. Linoone's fur is strong and supple, and the shed hairs are used to make high-quality shaving brushes. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Showdown at Linoone , Linoone has an attraction to anything round and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keeps on its territory. Linoone tends to live in grasslands . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Linoone has a regional form : Galarian Linoone. Galarian Linoone has a black-and-white color scheme, with longer fur on its ears. Around its red eyes are patterned stripes shaped like a shooting star. It has longer claws with gray fur surrounding the front feet, and it has a long red tongue that sticks out of its mouth. Galarian Linoone are known to be rash and fearless, preferring to recklessly challenge opponents that are stronger than itself. Linoone is known to use its long tongue to taunt opponents. Once the foe is fully enraged, Linoone will hurl itself at them, tackling them by force. These traits make Galarian Linoone very popular among unhappy and angry youths in Galar , who have nowhere to take out their anger and frustrations. By charging at up to 60 miles per hour, it can deliver powerful Tackles and Headbutts with enough destructive force to even knock away a car. Linoone can be thrown off balance should it miss, however. The harsh environments in the Galar region, along with the fierce competition among the species, allows Linoone's survival instincts to improve, leading to the ability to evolve into Obstagoon .

As Mega Sableye, being bathed in Mega Evolution energy causes the red jewel on its chest to rip out of Sableye's skin and significantly increase in size; the detached jewel leaves a small hole in Mega Sableye's chest. Its ears elongate, and it gains a spike on the top of its head. Its teeth turn from white to yellow, and its eyes also change from pale blue to crimson red, with diagonal slits at their inner edges. Its back gains more gems: a second green one, a second red one, and two small yellow gems. The enlarged jewel is said to boast such incredible hardness that no attack can even leave a scratch on it. During battle, Mega Sableye shelters itself behind the jewel, from where it can take advantage of any openings its target leaves exposed. However, being forced to support its massive jewel leaves Sableye unable to turn quickly, making it vulnerable from behind. As seen in the animated series , the giant jewel wears off and shrinks as it blocks attacks. Once the jewel is reduced to a very small size, Sableye will eat it before reverting back from its Mega-Evolved state in the process.

Its most notable feature is a pair of large black jaws emerging from the back of its head. These jaws have a yellow, oval-shaped spot on their top surface. They contain ten sharp, metallic teeth - six on the top row and four on the bottom. While the jaws are actually transformed steel horns, Mawile can articulate them at will, using them to bite enemies with enough force to break an iron beam. These jaws are incapable of tasting, leading Mawile to use them to eat food it does not like. Mawile is typically found in caves . It uses its non-threatening appearance to make foes underestimate it, then attacks with its giant jaws, sometimes swallowing its prey whole. When engaged in battle, Mawile usually has its back turned to the enemy to make better use of its jaws. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex , Mawile tends to sleep while hugging its jaws occasionally. It is unknown whether it's a trap or not, unless one takes a closer look. Mawile has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Flattened Sleep , Jaw-Swinging Sleep , Jaw-Hugging Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Mawile can Mega Evolve into Mega Mawile. Mega Mawile has two sets of jaws protruding from the back of its head, and both sets have a spiky tuft of hair. It also seems to be able to control the jaws independently of one another. The ear-like extensions on its head are longer and have tips with two points. Its legs have grown longer, and its \"hakama\" is now magenta. Its arms now resemble thick sleeves, with magenta markings around the wrists. Mega Mawile can use both its jaws to grip on prey and tear them apart. These jaws thrash around violently. Mega Mawile \u2191 http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Mawile"

Wailord is able to eat large quantities at one time, such as schools of Wishiwashi . However, it will flee from Wishiwashi when the latter is in its School Form. Wailord has an easygoing temperament and loves to play. Its size causes it to have almost no natural enemies; its only known predator is Dhelmise . Wailord lives in the sea in large groups called pods. These pods, which often include Wailmer , travel together in order to search for food. When a Wailmer is attacked by its predators Sharpedo or Dhelmise, its whole pod works to defend it. Wailord can dive deep at 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) in one breath. Wailord is popular due to its size. As a result, Wailord-watching is a favorite sightseeing activity in various parts of the world. However, Wailord are known to be driven away by fishermen when they become too numerous, so they don't eat too much fish Pok\u00e9mon. Evolution [ edit | edit source ] Wailord evolves from Wailmer .

It can be found in caves , particularly when the outside weather lacks snow. In the animated series , Glalie is depicted floating in midair and moving freely, similar to flying, and can even be ridden as a form of transport . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Glalie can Mega Evolve into Mega Glalie. Mega Glalie's jaw is dislocated because of the overwhelming energy, causing its mouth to extend to the length of its face. The lower jaw is all black except for two light-blue, conical, icy spikes. The pupils in Mega Glalie's eyes are now red instead of black. The horns on top Mega Glalie's head have been partially turned into ice, with the addition of a third horn on its forehead. Mega Glalie can spill endless blizzards from its broken mouth, though it gets irritated by the fact that it can no longer consume its prey. The areas Mega Glalie often appears in, will cause the area to be whited out. Any prey that it envelopes within its mouth is frozen instantly.

It has red-tipped, rudder-like wings on its shoulders and down its body, and similarly patterned fins on the tip of its tail. Yellow ring-like symbols run across the length of Rayquaza's body and it has an additional yellow ring on top of its head. Rayquaza has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat, horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small, yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper jaw. Rayquaza has a strong and endless desire to do heroic deeds for the Pok\u00e9mon world . Rayquaza is said to be equal to both Groudon and Kyogre. For that reason, it is the only one who can halt the endless battles of the other two super-ancient Pok\u00e9mon , by overpowering them and forcing both back into their slumber, even in their Primal Forms . . Rayquaza is also the only one who can stop the two and restore order to nature that they disrupted. Rayquaza is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years in the ozone layer , where it feeds on water and other particles. There, it feeds on meteoroids , which includes Mega Stones and even Minior . It also loves Rayquaza Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past. Rayquaza is rarely seen by people; even in flight, its appearance is indistinguishable from that of a meteor. For living in the ozone layer, it can breathe in outer space. Rayquaza possesses some of the strongest attack power out of any Pok\u00e9mon; it can easily summon cyclones to overwhelm its opponents. It can soar into the sky and drop out into its foes at high speeds , causing huge damage. Thanks to its weather-manipulation powers, it can eliminate weather effects . Rayquaza was worshiped by the Draconid people as the savior of the region since ancient times. Thus, they built the Sky Pillar to honor it. Additionally, it can be summoned atop Sky Pillar by multiple Key Stones . In Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , the Draconids referred to it as their \"Dragon Lord\". It is one of the longest-lived Pok\u00e9mon species. Inside its body lies an organ that contains the same power as a Mega Stone , which was named the \"mikado organ\" (Japanese: \u30df\u30ab\u30c9 \u5668\u5b98 ) by a Devon Corporation scientist. Rayquaza is bitter enemies with Deoxys , an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon that repeatedly invades its territory, with the two often clashing with each other in space. This is depicted in the movie Destiny Deoxys , the games Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire , and Masters EX . Rayquaza is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Dragon Ascent . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Air Lock as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Mega Rayquaza destroying a meteor Rayquaza can Mega Evolve into Mega Rayquaza.

As Mega Rayquaza, its body becomes longer and gains more features. Its head becomes longer with the \u0394 (delta) symbol appearing on its forehead. Rayquaza's eyes now contain yellow pupils with red irises, and black, shichishito -shaped markings trail behind its eyes. Its red lips and teeth become gold, and the gold lines connect to those on its lower horns, which take on a broad, triangular shape. At the outer edges of its lower horns are long, golden, glowing tendrils that each extend to a green, fin-like structure; these tendrils have ring patterns that strongly resemble the yellow markings running along the length of Rayquaza's normal form. While in flight, these tendrils give Mega Rayquaza a triangular profile. Its two upper horns become longer with a gold line running over them in a V shape, and each upper horn has another glowing tendril that ends in a circular shape with a spike. Along the length of its body are golden, glowing orbs placed where its ring patterns used to be. The chin, part of the neck, and parts of its serpentine body are changed to the color black. The fins running along its body are now marked with gold lines; the fins on its tail become entirely yellow and substantially longer. Particles stream from the long tendrils that extend from its jutting jaw; these particles can control the density and humidity of the air, allowing Mega Rayquaza to manipulate the weather. Its green hide sparkles with an emerald-like quality. Mega Rayquaza was said to have been born from humanity's wish for salvation, channeled through the Key Stone of a Draconid Lorekeeper. Rayquaza is the first recorded Pok\u00e9mon to achieve Mega Evolution and is at its full power when in the Mega Evolved state. Thanks to its weather-manipulating powers, it can change the weather to eliminate all of the Flying type 's weaknesses.

It has short, stubby legs and comparatively longer arms. There are flaps on the underside of its arms, which give the impression of long sleeves. On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third, yellow eye with a cyan pupil, known as its \"true eye\". Additionally, Jirachi has a normal pair of ovalish eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a teal tag, known as a \"wish tag\". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing Jirachi's face. Two yellow streamers flow from Jirachi's back, resembling comet tails. Jirachi hibernates for most of its life, awakening for seven days every thousand years. It can be also awakened if sung to by a voice of purity. While it sleeps, a tough, crystalline shell envelops its body to protect itself. However, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon , it can still fight while asleep. During the short periods it is awake in, Jirachi will grant wishes. However, how its wish powers work differ between canons . In the Jirachi: Wish Maker movie, Jirachi cannot create objects through its wishes, instead, it'll teleport the wished object to the one who wished for it. By contrast, in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Searching for a Wish! , it can grant wishes without the use of teleportation. In the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, Jirachi will only grant wishes when its true eye is opened. Additionally, it can only grant three wishes every thousand years, which are written on each of its three wish tags. It was also shown being able to create artificial Pok\u00e9mon through its wishes, animating a mass of seawater in the shape of a Kyogre . Jirachi's power is similarly exploited in the movie to create a monstrous Groudon . The movie further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the appearance of the Millennium Comet and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation. In Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Jirachi was shown to slumber in space. It is said that Jirachi's ability to grant wishes also gives it great attack power, as seen when it creates a concentrated bundle of light to blast its target.

There is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets. Deoxys was formed by the mutation of a virus from space. The Pok\u00e9mon is highly intelligent; its brain appears to be the crystal in its chest. This organ is capable of firing laser beams. It was also shown the ability to morph its tentacles into human -like hands. While inactive, it can also take the form of a triangular, stone tablet. As shown in Destiny Deoxys , it is able to regenerate any part of its body that it may have lost during a battle. It has also demonstrated the ability to create an aurora without changing its form. These auroras can have different electromagnetic wavelengths and are used to communicate with other Deoxys. It is also shown that the various electromagnetic waves given off by people, Pok\u00e9mon, and all electronics can obscure its vision if there is enough interference with its communication. Deoxys's different forms each possess different abilities and techniques. Deoxys regenerating itself In Destiny Deoxys and Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Deoxys has been observed to create clones of itself. These clones have lifeless eyes and duller color, lack of the trademark crystal on the chest, and seem to be unable to change from the Normal Forme. Furthermore, they seem unable to morph their tentacles into hands. When these clones are defeated, they dissolve into dust-like particles. Deoxys is bitter enemies with Rayquaza , with the two often clashing with each other, as depicted in several media. Deoxys is an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon that was coming towards the planet inside the Grand Meteor Delta during the Delta Episode , however, the meteor is destroyed and Deoxys is defeated or caught by the player and Mega Rayquaza.

Forms [ edit | edit source ] Deoxys floating in space in the form of a triangular, stone tablet Deoxys has four forms: Normal Forme, Attack Forme, Defense Forme, and Speed Forme. Normal Forme In its Normal Forme, Deoxys has tapering legs with a segmented, vertical, blue stripe on the upper portion. The abdomen is black with vertical lines, while the majority of its skin is reddish-orange. The arms are capable of taking different forms, usually a pair of tentacles coiled in a double helix. One tentacle is the primary skin color, while the other is light blue. Alternately, it can form more humanoid arms with a red top and blue underside and a five-fingered hand. This Forme has a blunt protrusion with a single blue stripe on either side of its head and stubby tail. It is the most balanced form. Attack Forme While in its Attack Forme, Deoxys's legs remain tapered. However, its blue stripes are no longer segmented and run the entire length of the leg and there is now a large spike on the knee. Two pairs of whip-like tentacles with pointed tips, one reddish-orange and one blue, replace its previous coiled, blunted tentacles. The protrusions on its head are now triangular with an additional one extending from the top of its head. Most of its reddish-orange skin has receded, revealing a striated, black chest and abdomen. Finally, its tail is now longer and more pointed. It is the most offensive form. Defense Forme Deoxys's Defense Forme has bulky, wide legs that are somewhat flat at the end with a bluish-green spot on each knee. It retains its two pairs of red and blue tentacles, but they are now flat and broad. The head has fused with its body and all protrusions are gone, causing it to resemble a helmet. The reddish-orange skin now covers the entire body, so none of its inner black portions are visible. There is now a single blue stripe on each shoulder, and its tail has disappeared. It is the most defensive form. Speed Forme The Speed Forme of this Pok\u00e9mon has a sleek black body with thin striation. The reddish-orange skin now covers only its head, hip joints, and the area around its crystal. There is now only one tentacle on each side of its body, one red and one blue. The protrusions on its head now point upward and the back of its head now forms a long spike. There is a long, thick blue stripe running down the center of this longer protrusion. More blue stripes appear on either hip joint and on its legs. It is the faster form. Normal Forme Attack Forme Defense Forme Speed Forme"

Bastiodon's triangular nose extends from the middle of its shield-like head down over its lips and appears to be pierced by a gray, horizontal spike. Four spikes jut downward and four large, blunt tusks protrude upward from its dark gray lower jaw. Bastiodon's cream-yellow eyes are partially obscured by the nasal spike and spaced-out tusks. Its thick, cream-yellow body is further protected by a gray ridge and dark gray plates on its back, jagged growths on its legs, and a plated tail. It is from roughly 100 million years ago. Bastiodon are known to live in herds. Despite its rough, intimidating appearance, Bastiodon is a docile, caring Pok\u00e9mon that feeds on grass and Berries . Its shield-like face is as tough as a diamond and capable of repelling any attack. When multiple Bastiodon line up side by side, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is helpless when attacked from behind. Because its facial bones are so hard, they were initially mistaken for its spine by researchers who found its fossils. Bastiodon has lived in the same habitats as Rampardos , as evidenced by their fossils frequently being found together, possibly from fighting each other to the death.

Each hexagon has a round, yellow face with two black, oval eyes and a black, curved mouth. In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes. They also each have a translucent, rounded-triangle-shaped wing connected to an orange, domed joint on their sides. The backsides of the upper faces are yellow and rounded, as the sides of a sphere. The bottom face is the main thinker of the three, and it is also the only one to have a full, insectoid abdomen. This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame. Female Combee have red, wedge-shaped spots on the foreheads of their lower faces, just below the point where all three faces meet; male Combee have no distinct markings in this area. Similar to other Pok\u00e9mon with multiple heads, such as Dugtrio and Dodrio , Combee's trio of faces each have their own consciousness. For example, each face has a different taste in nectar, and Combee can fly only when the top two faces coordinate the flapping of their wings. Each Combee's trio of faces has been together since birth. Unlike bees in real life, the vast majority of Combee are male. However, Combee are otherwise similar to bees in their social behavior. They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, Combee will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any Combee that tries to collect near it. Though Combee produce Honey for multiple purposes, they usually consume it. Each swarm of Combee makes a different flavor of honey. When not gathering nectar, Combee will protect their queen Vespiquen . They are very suggestible and will never defy the orders of their queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its Combee will not think twice about risking their lives to protect their queen, to the point of aggressively attacking or even killing the threat. Combee commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. Combee sleep by creating a hive with other Combee, locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers. Teddiursa and Mothim regularly raid Combee nests for the Honey they collected. Prior to Generation V , Honey Gather was Combee's signature Ability .

Its orange face has intimidating red eyes; yellow mandibles that protrude from its face and connect to its horns; and a large, red gem on its forehead. Vespiquen's horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion . Similar to queen bees in real life, Vespiquen is a female-only species. Vespiquen is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones. The more pheromones Vespiquen produces, the more Combee it will have in its hive. As queen, Vespiquen gives birth to and raises Combee grubs, feeding on flowers to make honey for its progeny; it also controls and protects its hive.

Like real-world sea slugs, they have mantles covering the top halves of their bodies. These mantles are outlined in yellow, similar to their eyes. Unlike real sea slugs, however, they have bulbous heads and four small feet rather than one large foot. The West Sea form's underside is white, and its mantle is pink, with several small spike-like protrusions on its back. On its head is a ring of pink, fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a nudibranch . West Sea Shellos' appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters. The East Sea form, meanwhile, sports a green underside and a turquoise mantle. Two yellow-lined, flap-like protrusions, resembling cerata , are present along its back. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling rhinophores that extend away from its face. East Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters. Shellos lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better quality of the waters it lives in. It is also believed that Shellos's diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, though this has yet to be proven. The physical differences between both forms appear largely cosmetic; no significant changes in capabilities have been observed. While it can travel onto land, it can only stay on the shore for a limited time before its skin dries out. When Shellos' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when Shellos senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid \u2014 theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat \u2014 will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the animated series , West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well. This species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pok\u00e9mon such as Shellder . The Nurse Joy featured in Gateway to Ruin! revealed Mount Coronet 's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two.

It has a small, triangular pink nose, pink paw pads on the undersides of its feet, and small tan spots above its eyes. It has a small brown puff of a tail. Buneary almost always keeps one of its ears rolled up. Although Professor Laventon had hypothesized that this is done to protect its hearing, in actuality, Buneary rolls its ears so it can quickly unroll them and launch them as an attack. The attack is strong enough to hurt grown-ups and crush boulders, and increases in power as Buneary trains to use it. Buneary can also use this technique to jump really high, by slamming its ears towards the ground. Buneary's arms and legs are weaker by comparison. If Buneary senses danger, it perks up both ears; conversely, if Buneary rolls both of its ears in, it is a sign that it is unhealthy. On cold nights, Buneary sleeps with its head tucked into its fur. It lives in forests, though it can also be found on icy mountains.

This collection of spirits is known for its misdeeds; thus, as punishment, the spirits were trapped to its Odd Keystone by a traveler using a mysterious spell.

Its dorsal fin is strong enough to carry a person. In the past, Gible lived in the tropics. Gible appears to be a good digger, making deep holes for homes in caverns warmed by geothermal heat. This heated environment allows Gible to survive even during the winter. It has also been seen huddling with other members of its species to stave off the cold, although it enjoys play-fighting with them as well. Gible is typically sighted in rocky areas, such as mountains. Gible has tremendously strong jaws that it uses to bite enemies and prey alike, dragging the latter back into its nest. However, even while biting, it often hurts itself because of clumsiness. This sometimes causes its teeth to chip and fall off in the process, but Gible is never bothered by this because the teeth will grow back after a few days.

Garchomp has horn-like appendages that resemble a jet or plane 's engines, giving it an appearance similar to a hammerhead shark . These horns allow it to sense its prey from a long distance. Its large mouth features razor-sharp teeth. The feet have three white talons, and each arm has a single large, white claw for a hand. Curved fins sprout from the arms, creating wings that allow Garchomp to fly. Garchomp also has a large dorsal fin and another on its tail that resembles a shark tailfin . The male's dorsal fin has a notch on it. Pairs of small, white spikes protrude from its upper arms and legs, and there are gill-like slits on the sides of the neck.

After catching prey, it returns to its den before its body can cool down. The fine scales on its body reduce drag for easier flight, and their sharp edges also serve to injure opponents who attack it directly. It can use its protuberances as sensors for finding distinct prey. Garchomp lives in mountainous regions, both volcanic and boreal, and typically dwells underground. However, it is seldom sighted in the wild. Garchomp is described as having a feral nature, requiring extreme caution should anyone encounter it. In Generation IX , Garchomp and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Rough Skin as an Ability .

Its hands, feet, and tail are dark green and spiky, similar to the foliage of an evergreen tree. On its back are four green spikes that resemble pinecones. Abomasnow lives in snowy mountains and appears only when snow flowers bloom. Once the flowers die, it retreats to isolated areas because Abomasnow prefers to be alone and not associate with others. It is able to create blizzards to hide itself and can also cause whiteout conditions with just a shake of its massive body. Abomasnow is also known as the \"Ice Monster\" and \"abominable snowman\". It protects Snover from packs of Galarian Darumaka , who chase them for the Berries they grow, by swinging its arms like hammers. Abomasnow is powerful enough to split huge boulders in two. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , a sleeping Abomasnow can still cause blizzards by occasionally swinging its arms. Researchers acknowledged that it is unknown why Abomasnow does this, though it is theorized that it is either a habit to hide itself or just sleepy flailing. Prior to Generation VI , Abomasnow and its pre-evolved form, Snover , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Snow Warning as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Abomasnow can Mega Evolve into Mega Abomasnow. The sprouts on its back grow into great shafts of ice when this Pok\u00e9mon Mega Evolves into Mega Abomasnow.

Weavile live in snow-covered areas and are notorious predators. Weavile is famed for its speed and agility. Weavile is also known for its intelligence and cunning nature, thanks to its brain having developed as it evolves from Sneasel . A scratch from Weavile's sharp claws can cause frostbite. Weavile travel in packs of four or five, with one of them acting as the pack leader. They hunt for prey such as Alolan Sandshrew , Alolan Vulpix , and species as large as Mamoswine , then divide up the prey amongst themselves. Weavile can communicate with each other by carving patterns into trees, ice, and boulders, with over 500 distinct signs recorded. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Weavile has been observed gesturing in its sleep, possibly trying to challenge someone in its dreams.

Magnezone's tough steel body is wide and circular, similar to a disc or saucer, with a thin edge circling the diameter of its body. Its main eye is in the center, containing a large, red pupil. On each side of its body, it has a ball-shaped addition that resembles a Magnemite, with each side containing an eye, horseshoe magnet, and Phillips head screw. These secondary eyes can move independently of its main eye, as shown in Confronting the Darkness! . On top of its head is a tall, thin, yellow rod, closely resembling an antenna, which it uses for certain attacks. Behind its body is a third horseshoe magnet, positioned like a tail. Magnezone's Evolution is theorized to have been caused by a special magnetic field that changed the molecular structure within its body. Magnezone is a seemingly-mechanical, gender-unknown creature, but it has emotions, a way of reproducing, and the need for nourishment. With its magnets, it has the ability to control anti-gravity and float through the air at will. As seen in Giratina and the Sky Warrior and Phantom Thief Pok\u00e9mon 7 , Magnezone's anti-gravity is strong enough to carry humans with ease. Magnezone is rarely sighted in the wild. As seen in Regaining the Home Advantage! , Magnezone can be very aggressive and territorial, although it will rarely attack without provocation. It flies through the night sky, often mistaken for a UFO sighting, though it seems to be receiving and sending signals from an unknown source and an unknown purpose. This leads some people to believe that Magnezone came from outer space and that it is being controlled by unknown beings. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Magnezone's screws and magnets will spin while it sleeps. It is believed that a sleeping Magnezone emits signals of unknown purpose and receiving signals of unknown origin. However, researchers are divided on if this point is true or not.

There is a yellow band near the top of its head, and a short, yellow antenna with a disc-shaped tip extends from on top. Six flat projections extend from the base of its neck and surround its head, resembling an upturned collar . Dusknoir has well-developed arms with two yellow bands near its wrists and large, gray hands. On the front of its torso are two almond-shaped markings, and on its back are two circular markings. Both sets of markings resemble eyes. A yellow band encircles its body, zigzagging along the front and forming a long curve around the back. It has a wispy tail in place of feet. The antenna on Dusknoir's head allows it to receive transmissions from the spirit world , which tell it to bring people there. Dusknoir usually appears to those who are dead and bring their souls to the afterlife. Because of this, people highly fear Dusknoir. Sometimes, Dusknoir may accidentally take away the souls of those still alive, though this rarely happens. However, the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Ghoul Daze! has shown it protecting innocent people from being taken to the spirit world. It is unknown if Dusknoir has a will of its own, or if it is forced to follow the bidding of the transmissions it receives. The band on its body can open, similar to a mouth. Dusknoir is capable of using its belly mouth to swallow its target whole. It also uses this ability to take spirits into its body and carry them home or as it travels to unknown places. Dusknoir only consumes spectral essence, leaving only the empty remains of living beings untouched. As shown in The Truth Revealed! , Dusknoir can eat with the mouth on its stomach.

When moving quickly, these appendages tend to disappear, in favor of a long similar-looking trail of blue electricity. It has teeth, and its unique, blue eyes have a dividing line across them. In its base form, Rotom cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being shocked in the process. According to the Rotom Catalog , Rotom in its base form is possessing a light bulb. Rotom lack any sort of circulatory system or pulse. Rotom have the ability to enter and control appliances. They typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Get Your Rotom Running! . Despite this, some Rotom have taken to inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The Rotom Pok\u00e9dex , Rotom Phones , Rotomi , and Drone Rotom are some examples.

Dialga has a five-spiked fin-like structure on its back similar to a gear, three spines on the back of its neck, and a crest on its head, resembling a dinosaur. The crest somewhat resembles the shape of a sundial's rod. It also has two structures on the sides of its head that extend outward and resemble horns and fangs. It has three claws on each foot, of the same metallic look as its chest plate. Dialga has the power to control time; it can warp time by either speeding it up, slowing it down, reversing it, or stopping it altogether. It can also travel through time to visit the past, present, and future. Additionally, it is capable of blasting its targets with power that distorts time itself . It also has the power to destroy and create an entire universe, either by itself or with Palkia's aid. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series , Dialga's temporal powers possess the ability to devolve anything or anyone against their will, including Pok\u00e9mon , people , and plant life . It can reverse these effects as well. It is said that time started moving when Dialga was born and will continue flowing as long as its heart beats. Dialga usually travels by levitating. Since Dialga primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. In the dimension where Dialga lives in, time is said to be constantly moving in different directions and speeds. In the anime, it has been shown to be very protective of its home, and as a result, tends to have violent conflicts with Palkia when their dimensions intersect. The fin-like structure on its back is shaped radiating outwards and can be used to focus the flow of time, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon . According to the myths and legends of the Sinnoh region , in the beginning of time, the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Arceus created the Pok\u00e9mon of time\u2013Dialga, the Pok\u00e9mon of space\u2013 Palkia , and the Pok\u00e9mon of antimatter\u2013 Giratina , all three in their Origin Formes .

It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the Diamond Clan , who referred to it as \"almighty Sinnoh\". Dialga is capable of speaking human language via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Diamond Clan, Adaman .

The back legs of Dialga become unguligrade in shape and have pointed tips instead of feet. The front legs are noticeably larger, with three distinct rhomboid claws on the underside. Further up, Dialga's knees have rectangular, long, and thin protrusions. Its chest plate is gone; however, it has a similar polygonal shape in its place. On Dialga's neck is a large shape jutting out towards the front (giving it the appearance of a larger throat), along with two pairs of protrusions on either side, the upper pair being larger and resembling panels or wings. Inside this large shape and wing-like protrusions are deep blue diamond-like crystals, embedded into diamond-shaped grooves. The three spines located on the back of the neck are longer and sharper. Dialga's head has two thin arrow-shaped horns extending towards the top and back of its head, along with longer fang-like horns connected to a plate mask covering its lower jaw, which can shift in angle to reveal the mouth. The plate mask also partly covers the arrow-shaped horns on their sides. Around Dialga's abdomen is a cross made of four arrow shapes attached to a small wheel, reminiscent of Arceus's cross-wheel. The fin-like plate on Dialga's posterior has a star-shaped layer on top of it. The tail is much shorter and crystal-shaped. Overall, Dialga's entire body becomes larger and nearly completely dark blue. The crest, arrow-shaped horns, knee protrusions, and abdomen cross are light blue, while the tips of Dialga's fin-like plate and feet are dark gray. Dialga is at its full power when in its Origin Forme, and is supposedly permanently in this state while in its home dimension. Dialga's transformation into its Origin Forme is triggered by a radiant light; it can also be invoked using the Adamant Crystal .

Giratina is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. It remains in its Altered Forme while outside of its home dimension . Unlike in the games, Pok\u00e9mon movies depict Giratina only opening portals through reflective surfaces. Giratina also had many different titles throughout the years: \"the banished Pok\u00e9mon\", \"Arceus's shadow\", \"the Pok\u00e9mon of Shadows\", and \"the being on the other side of our world\". Giratina is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shadow Force by leveling up. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Origin Forme Giratina's plate mask opened Giratina can change between its Altered Forme and Origin Forme. Compared to Palkia and Dialga, both of which resemble Arceus in their Origin Formes, Giratina's Origin Forme takes on a serpentine look. Its legs are reduced to golden-tipped spikes, and four additional golden spikes appear near the edge of its tail. While in Origin Forme, the six gold half-rings can grip objects. The back points of each half-ring have a black ghostly tendril with a red spike at its tip. The horns on its head are now facing the back. The sides of the golden \"crown\" cover its mouth and separate vertically like an insect's mandible when it opens its mouth. The black vertical stripe is broken into pieces and runs down its body. The Origin Forme of Giratina is said to be Giratina's true form, capable of traveling through and controlling dimensions besides those of\u00a0time and space. Giratina can only be in its Origin Forme when in its home, the Distortion World , or when holding either a Griseous Orb or Griseous Core . Giratina can also maintain its Origin Forme in the real world without items should it get a sufficient amount of power, enough to potentially be equal to Arceus. Giratina is at its full power when in the Origin Forme, and is always levitated in this state. When in its Origin Forme, it can pass through dimensions at will, although it will turn back to its Altered Forme due to the gravity change from the Distortion World. Giratina has the power to turn itself into a shadow and to merge the Distortion World with the Pok\u00e9mon world , as seen during the events of Spear Pillar . However, this has the dangerous side effect of distorting it to the risk of being destroyed. In Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Giratina was shown to be capable of using the terrain of the Distortion World to encase and trap its targets. Altered Forme Origin Forme"

Darkrai is known to \"inhabit\" dreams and causes the target to have unending nightmares, which can be stopped if exposed to a Lunar Feather from Cresselia . However, the \"unleashing of nightmares\" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. Darkrai is capable of flying at high speeds, and it can become a shadow in order to escape danger or contact with humans. It is also capable of some human speech. In The Rise of Darkrai , it was shown its power was weaker than that of Dialga and Palkia .

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] The unnamed form Arceus takes in its realm In its Normal-type form, Arceus is a white, equine Pok\u00e9mon with an androgynous appearance. It resembles a qilin or centaur with a gray, vertically striated underside. The striated pattern also appears on the underside of its mane, tail, and face. Its four pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its long mane juts away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes, red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. Arceus also has a streak of gold coloration on its head, which point upward. Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of the body. Arceus also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen. The wheel also has four jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly continues past its waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is similar to its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, Arceus is capable of flight. According to legend, it shaped the Pok\u00e9mon universe using its 1,000 arms. Arceus has been referred to as the \"Original One\" in myths and legends and is generally considered one of the strongest Pok\u00e9mon. Arceus is believed to be the creator of the Sinnoh and Ransei regions , the Pok\u00e9mon world , and possibly, even the entire Pok\u00e9mon universe . It also created the eggs in which the Pok\u00e9mon of Myth : Dialga , Palkia , and Giratina hatched out of, as well as the one in which the lake guardians : Uxie , Azelf , and Mesprit hatched out of. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the longest-lived Pok\u00e9mon species. It also could recreate these eggs if it wanted to. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life , Arceus is portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. In the same movie, it is said to \"feed\" off the energy of its Plates. Arceus recreating the egg of one of the Pok\u00e9mon of Myth in the Sinjoh Ruins Arceus does not suffer fools gladly and will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In Hoopa and the Clash of Ages , it was shown to be able to stop the destruction caused by a space-time void. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode Showdown at the Gates of Warp! , Arceus has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia, but also destroy the Red Chain controlling them. It can release countless shots of light that disintegrate the landscape around it. Arceus can change its type at will to adapt to a situation through the use of its Plates or type-specific Z-Crystals . Arceus also has the power to split in two, creating a piece of itself to exist outside of its realm, which is implied to be its physical form\u2014only a piece of its whole being\u2014while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible. Arceus was known to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times, protecting the world from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion to those who treated it with kindness. In modern times, Arceus continues to watch over the world and wishes for people and Pok\u00e9mon to work together in the face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it only gives hints on how to solve problems instead of directly interfering. Arceus can also give its blessing to other Pok\u00e9mon through bolts of light, making them bigger and more powerful, as seen with the ancient hero 's 10 Pok\u00e9mon companions. This blessing is also passed down through family lines, as seen with the descendants of the hero's Pok\u00e9mon: the noble Pok\u00e9mon and ride Pok\u00e9mon worshipped by the people of Hisui . In Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus , Arceus transformed a normal cellphone into an Arc Phone , a device that allows humans to communicate with it through text messages. Arceus also has the power to appear in dreams and create a variety of Pok\u00e9mon to serve as challenges, as seen in Eternal Battle Reverie . In Pok\u00e9mon Masters EX , through the sync stones ultimate , Arceus can give its blessing to a Trainer it deems worthy, transforming their outfits into costumes known as arc suits . As a result, their sync pair is blessed as well, granting them a divine move over their normal sync move . In Arceus and the Jewel of Life , using its Earth , Splash , Meadow , Zap , and Draco Plates , Arceus created the Jewel of Life , a powerful artifact capable of turning a desolate land into a rich and fertile one. Like its the ones it created, Arceus also resides in another dimension, a realm beyond time and space itself. There, it appears in a large body of golden light shaped like the silhouette of its normal appearance. That could possibly be its true form. It was also shown to be capable of human speech , stating that \"Arceus\" is simply the name humans call it. The first ancient inhabitants of the Hisui region , the Celestica people , worshipped it, referring to it as \"almighty Sinnoh\", \"great Sinnoh\", and \"might of Sinnoh\", with the term \"Sinnoh\" later on becoming the name of the region . The Diamond Clan and Pearl Clan also worship it, though they mistook Dialga and Palkia respectively for Arceus. In ancient myths, it is said that the Origin Ore , an ore of mysterious power, contains the power of Arceus itself. In Alola , the Aether Foundation used Arceus's data, collected on myths and legends from Canalave City 's library , during the Beast killer project to create the artificial Pok\u00e9mon Type: Full , with an Ability ( RKS System ) similar to Arceus's ( Multitype ), being developed to protect Alola from Ultra Beasts . However, the project was deemed a failure and was later abandoned, sealing Type: Full's ability with a control helmet, which caused it to devolve and be renamed Type: Null . Arceus is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Judgment . It is also able to use charged-up versions of the Pok\u00e9mon of Myth 's signature moves ( Roar of Time , Spacial Rend and Shadow Force ), as seen in its boss battle in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus. Additionally, Arceus is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Multitype as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Arceus has eighteen different forms, one for each type . Thanks to its Ability , Arceus is capable of changing its form and type according to the Plate or type-specific Z-Crystal that it wields; its eyes, underbelly, face, hooves, snout, and cross-like wheel all change color to match its current type.

Its head, dorsal coat, and limbs are royal blue, and its underbelly is a dull bluish-gray. It has pointed canine teeth, and a red nose, and its eyes have white sclera and circular red irises. Long white whiskers resembling mustaches extend from its snout and lower jaw. Samurott possesses three black claws on each limb, and a fin-like tail resembling a war fan. Samurott's head, limbs, and tail are adorned with cream-colored armor resembling seashells. The armor on its head resembles a spiked conch shell. This helmet-like armor is bulbous in the back, and tapers into a spear-like horn in the front. Segmented armor resembling bracers covers each of Samurott's limbs. The forelimbs' bracers contain shell swords called seamitars . The two lower segments of these bracers serve as scabbards for these seamitars, and the upper segment and spike are the seamitars' blade and handle, respectively. In battle, Samurott can stand on its hind limbs and use its seamitars to fight. In the time it takes a foe to blink, Samurott can draw, attack with, and sheathe the seamitars attached to its front legs. It is said that Samurott can fell an opponent in one swing, and that it can silence foes with a glare or a howl. Samurott is a master of a sword-drawing art called iaijutsu . Samurott leads its group with strict leadership and will mercilessly thrash those who do not follow its rules with the group. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Hisuian Samurott using its seamitar Samurott has a regional form : Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a rare regional variant of Samurott native to the Hisui region. The color of its coat and the shape of its body are similar to its Unovan counterpart, but the texture of its whiskers, as well as the texture and color of its shell armor, are quite different. Its whiskers are wavy, as opposed to the straight whiskers of Unovan Samurott, and the lower set of whiskers are much longer. The shell armor covering its head and limbs is black with red accents. The shell on its head features two lateral spines absent in Unovan Samurott, and the spiny, anterior horn is crooked and wavy. Hisuian Samurotts' bracers have sharper, more curved edges than those of Unovan Samurott, as do its seamitars, which have wavy blades. Hisuian Samurott has one less layer of shell armor on its hind limbs than Unovan Samurott. The armored portion of its tail is also longer and wavier than its Unovan counterpart. Another comparison of its Unovan counterpart is it lacks its chest marking. Its claws are red. Hisuian Samurott is said to have a cold and hard-hearted nature and is deft with its shell blades. Unlike its Unovan counterpart, which prefers to fight fair, Hisuian Samurott will do anything to win a battle and prefers to use tricks, surprise attacks, and cheap shots. It remains still and silent until it sees an opponent. Then in the blink of an eye, Hisuian Samurott draws its seamitars and thrusts them at its enemies. The attacks Hisuian Samurott unleashes are likened to the ceaseless crashing of waves, and can confuse and overwhelm opponents. The wounds inflicted by Hisuian Samurott are said to take many years to heal. Hisuian Samurott is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Ceaseless Edge .

One of the light green leaves, on the back of its head, is about as long as its body and resembles hair. Two light green leaves loosely hang down from its head. Its head and abdomen are white and its eyes, which resemble seeds, are a light shade of scarlet. It has dark green, linear leaves for arms, and a golden sepal under its neck. It wears a large, light green, tulip shaped collection of leaves, resembling a dress. There are two long, dark green, linear leaves coming from its back to around the bottom of its \"dress\". It also possesses another golden, sepal-shaped extension underneath its \"dress\", resembling feet. Though Lilligant is popular with celebrities, veteran Trainers and first-rate gardeners alike have struggled to coax the flower on Lilligant's head into blooming. The flowers bloomed by Lilligant in the wild are also said to be the most beautiful despite all these efforts. Once it blooms, it will wilt if Lilligant is then neglected or when it finds a male partner. The flower emits a sweet-smelling aroma, and it is believed to have a relaxing effect on those exposed to the scent. The flower's fragrance differs slightly depending on the soil it was cultivated in. The oil made by Lilligant's flowers has a sublime scent and is very expensive to buy.

The scent released from this flower causes anyone nearby to experience a heartened feeling. Its eyes are light pink and purple. The leaves on its head that resemble hair are much shorter than on Unovan Lilligant. The sepal around its neck is also smaller. Hisuian Lilligant's arms are green, with its forearms being a lighter green. They are much longer and thinner than those of Unovan Lilligant. It also has long, powerful legs, and they are white with a dark pink gradient at the calves. Its feet are golden and cover part of its legs, and they seem to resemble dance shoes or snow boots . Hisuian Lilligant is suspected to have its legs developed as a result of living in the snowy mountains of Hisui ; they allow it to jump very high and gracefully. The scent in its flower crown heartens those in proximity. Its attacks take form of ballet-like moves, almost like it's dancing during battle. A special Hisuian Lilligant is worshiped in Hisui due to her being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pok\u00e9mon who received a blessing from Arceus.

They have a green, ovoid body, tapering off in the rear to a trapezoidal tail fin. A thick black stripe covers the top of their body from mouth to tail and a white, dorsal fin with four protrusions resembling spikes. Their lower jaw juts ahead of their upper jaw, with a small indent near the edges of their mouth. Both forms have three black dots on both sides of their body, behind their pectoral fins. The main difference between the three forms of Basculin is the color of the stripe that separates the black and green on their body. All forms of Basculin have fins in the same places, with one on top of their body ahead of the tail fin, one below the body ahead of the tail fin, and two side fins. The Red-Striped Form has jagged fins that resemble tridents, whereas the Blue-Striped Form has smooth fins all around. The Red-Striped Form has circular, red eyes, while the Blue-Striped Form has narrower, blue eyes. Red- and Blue-Striped Basculin are extremely hostile, especially towards their opposite form. They generally start fighting each other on sight for territory. However, on rare occasions, one form may swim with the other's school. Basculin is full of vitality and reproduces quickly. When a school of Basculin appears in a lake, Pok\u00e9mon other than Corphish and Crawdaunt flee. It competes with Carvanha for food. Basculin has often been referred to as \"the thug of the lake\" or \"Thug of the River\", and uses its jaws, which are strong enough to leave bite marks in iron sheets, to devour everything in its way. However, despite their fierce reputation, Basculin become prey to stronger organisms, such as Bombirdier and Dondozo . Basculin were once also consumed by humans , and were considered very delicious. The meat of Blue-Striped Basculin has an inoffensive, light flavor, while the meat of Red-Striped Basculin is fattier, and was more popular with the youth. Basculin is a popular Pok\u00e9mon with anglers due to its resistance. Many people release Basculin into lakes illegally, causing its population to grow abundant. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Basculin has three separate forms: Red-Striped Form, Blue-Striped Form, and White-Striped Form, the last of which is sometimes considered a regional form . In Hisui , White-Striped Basculin has a similar appearance to the other two forms of Basculin. Despite its descriptor, the stripes above its eyes are actually a very pale shade of light blue, as are its irises. Its pectoral fins are smooth like Blue-Striped Basculin, but larger. Its dorsal fins are spiky and it has wide eyes, like Red-Striped Basculin. Its lower jaw is smaller than the jaws of either Red- or Blue-Striped Basculin, and both its lower and upper jaws have beak-like protrusions at the front. Unlike the other two forms, White-Striped Basculin are known to be gentle, with an ecology different enough from other Basculin to spawn recent theories of it being a separate species. White-Striped Basculin are known to share food with each other unlike their two counterparts. They are known to travel upstream; the journey is often perilous for the species, and many of them don't survive. As a result, the souls of the deceased White-Striped Basculin are often left behind in the waters of Hisui. However, when an injured White-Striped Basculin survives, it can unite with the souls in order to achieve the unique evolution into Basculegion .

This membrane prevents sand from getting in Sandile's eyes and helps it see in the harsh desert sun. Its long snout is tipped by two protruding nostrils, and its mouth comprises the bottom half. Its feet are flat and contain three sharp, black claws. They are attached to stubby legs on its sides. Sandile is only found in deserts, with the exception of Alola , where the warm environment is comfortable enough for them to appear elsewhere. It usually burrows under the surface of the sand, with only its nose and eyes appearing above ground. Due to being so close to the surface, it can move around the desert and allow the heat of the sand to regulate its body temperature. This also serves as a way of hiding from enemies. Its movement through sand has been described as being similar to swimming. When the sun sets, it burrows deep into the sand to sleep until sunrise. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode A Sandile Gusher of Change! , in the wild, Sandile can be mischievous and potentially troublesome to humans. However, Sandile will protect another of its species, and can be caring at times. Sandile is an ambush predator, hiding under the sand and waiting for unwary prey, such as Trapinch , to walk over it before it bites on their legs.

Krokorok prefers to live in the desert, usually in small groups. The black membrane surrounding its eyes protects them from sandstorms and acts as a thermal detector. This allows Krokorok to see the temperature of different objects, which also gives it exceptional night vision. This enables it to hunt in the dead of night without getting lost. However, it never moves much during the night. A group of Krokorok usually consists of a few individuals. The group is led by a female Krokorok while the males gather food.

Its head has no discernible neck to distinguish it from the rest of the body and its rounded back, which culminates in a stubby tail. It has long arms with spiky hair fringes on the wrists and large tan hands, with a similar arrangement for its hind limbs. Additionally, Darmanitan has three tan ovals on its underside and two wavy lines on its back. In its normal state, it has immense physical strength; a single punch can destroy a dump truck. Its power level scales with the temperature of its internal fire, which can be as hot as 2,500\u00a0\u00b0F (1,400\u00a0\u00b0C).

Zen Mode During Zen Mode, which is accessed by Darmanitan with the hidden Ability Zen Mode , its red fur and tan skin changes blue as it bears the resemblance of a Daruma doll. Its eyes turn blank, and its limbs fuse with its body, rendering them immobile. It also only has three toes, as opposed to normal Darmanitan having five. In this state, it is hard as a rock.

Its fur is white, and is adorned with several ice gems; on its face, its fur makes the shape of a beard. Atop its head is a giant snowball that resembles an afro, which is also dotted with several ice crystals. Galarian Darmanitan's biology is the result of it adapting to the cold of the Galar region. It develops an organ that produces cold air, while its flame sac becomes dormant. This also causes its nature to change, from a belligerent personality to a gentle and timid one. It becomes so timid that it will pretend to be a snowman when it senses humans nearby. It uses the snowball on its head to store food and other things it finds, preserving them for later. When in battle, it freezes its giant snowball in order to release powerful headbutts. Galarian Zen Mode Galarian Zen Mode Darmanitan resembles a snowman. Its false \"head\", located above its actual head, has glowing red-yellow eyes, a warped smile, and a flame sticking out at the center as its \"carrot nose\". Its face sports blank white eyes surrounded by a red mask-like pattern, and an angry grin showing razor-sharp teeth. Its hands become larger and orange, resembling mittens, and it has additional glowing red-yellow spots on its belly. When Galarian Darmanitan enters Zen Mode, its dormant flame sac reignites back to life. This causes Galarian Darmanitan's disposition to change into a maddened rampaging state.

Both genders have five tentacles, two of which are long with petal-shaped ends. The remaining three are short and tapered. A male is blue with a short white crown, and a white collar whose front portion resembles a mustache. Its eyes are red with blue sclerae, and there is one eyelash over each eye. Its long tentacles have white edges, while its short tentacles have white spots. A female is pink with a tall white crown and a puffy white collar. Its eyes are blue with red sclerae and surrounded by two eyelashes. Just below its eyes is a red heart-shaped marking which resembles a mouth. The long tentacles have white edges like the male, but the short ones have white frills. Jellicent can absorb seawater and project it from its head, which lets it move forward in the sea. Jellicent's body composition is similar to seawater. Schools of Jellicent are known to gather for prey during a full moon. Any fancy cruise ships, tankers, or crew that wander into the oceans where it dwells are never found again, and it is rumored that it drags these ships or tankers into the sea and preys on its passengers. It can create lairs from sunken ships. It is known to feed on life energy, where the more it drains, the bigger its crown gets. Jellicent are highly feared by fishers.

The two larger eyes are set relatively far apart on its face, containing black pupils. The two smaller simple eyes are situated between the first pair, slightly higher up on its face. Joltik's mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair. It is capable of producing silk from these mandibles, enabling it to hang from trees. At 4 inches (0.1 meters) tall, Joltik is one of the shortest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. In fact, it is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pok\u00e9mon and feeds off their static electricity. More than often it prefers sticking on Yamper 's hindquarters. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body.

Zweilous has the vigor and energy to eat and bite constantly without stopping. Its heads dislike each other and are very hostile. If neither head is given equal attention by someone, they will fight out of envy. Each head has their own likes and dislikes. As a result, the heads often turn eating into a competition, each head trying to claim leadership by eating more than the other. Because of this, Zweilous always eats far too much and is covered in scars, even without opponents to fight. This allows Zweilous to become stronger without any allies helping it.

Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms, and tail. It has two arms, each with two claws, and each arm is joined by its oddly-shaped, blue ice wings. Each wing has two spikes which are bioluminescent. If its wings are broken, gray tendril-like appendages are revealed on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender and have three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine. Kyurem generates powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body becomes frozen when the energy leaks out. It appears that this Pok\u00e9mon uses its ice powers to freeze its own body in order to stabilize its cellular structure. It is said to have a power that exceeds that of Reshiram and Zekrom , however, this power is kept at bay by the extreme cold. Kyurem can use its tendril-like appendages to transform Reshiram and Zekrom back into their respective Dragon Stones and even absofuse with them while they're in that state. In Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , similarly to Reshiram and Zekrom, Kyurem is somehow capable of flying even with its frozen wings. According to the Village of Dragons 's Elder in Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice , Kyurem is considered one of the strongest Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon in the world. Kyurem is powerful enough to cover Opelucid City and even the entire Unova region in ice. Kyurem loves Kyurem Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past. According to an old legend in Lacunosa Town , Kyurem is an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon that crashlanded on the planet inside either an icy meteor or a Dragon Stone , creating the Giant Chasm . This same legend describes Kyurem as hostile towards Pok\u00e9mon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly devoured them if they were found outside of Lacunosa Town during the night. However, according to another old legend told by Drayden , Kyurem was created by the leftovers of the single powerful Dragon Pok\u00e9mon owned by the twin heroes of Unova after it split up into Reshiram and Zekrom. Its true origin is unknown. Kyurem is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Glaciate by leveling up. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Kyurem has two alternate forms: White Kyurem and Black Kyurem. These forms are formed by absofusing with Reshiram and Zekrom , respectively, sharing many aspects of their designs with them. It can absofuse with them in their respective Dragon Stones to change to White or Black Kyurem. The reason for this is due to the sameness of Kyurem, Reshiram, and Zekrom's genes, allowing said fusion. As a result, Kyurem also shares Reshiram or Zekrom's beliefs in truth or ideals, respectively, when fused with either of the two dragons. It's also said to wait for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with truth or ideals. In Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice , Kyurem can also change into Black Kyurem or White Kyurem without fusing by channeling the powers of both Reshiram and Zekrom it has within itself. White Kyurem White Kyurem in Overdrive mode White Kyurem resembles a hybrid version of itself and Reshiram. When transformed into White Kyurem, its legs are just like the original, but shorter, and the middle toe becomes ice. As White Kyurem, it has some extra icy details on the legs. Its tail resembles that of Reshiram but is attached to the body with three gray parts of the skin. The tail is capable of movement and contains four holes that are located horizontally on either side. White Kyurem's torso is also slimmer, especially when compared to its counterpart, Black Kyurem. Its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from the back of each, which can come out and 'plug into' the aforementioned holes in its tail. As White Kyurem, it has slender arms with three claws each, and wings located on its forearms; additionally, while the majority of its right arm is frozen, its left arm is bare, revealing two silvery cuffs resembling those of Reshiram. Its neck is the same shape but becomes upright along with the posture of the Pok\u00e9mon. The ice covering Kyurem's upper jaws has partially disappeared, allowing it to open its mouth. Like Black Kyurem, it now has white eyes with black pupils. During a battle, White Kyurem enters Overdrive mode , and tubes sprout from its icy shoulders to its tail. In White Kyurem's case, the ends of its hair and wings become red-hot and its tail acquires fiery highlights that extend from the base to the tip. White Kyurem can use both the power of fire and ice due to fusing with Reshiram. White Kyurem can also fly using its wings and the jet engine-like tail. Due to Reshiram's influence, White Kyurem firmly believes in the pursuit of truth. Due to foreseeing a world of truth, it will fight to protect said future for both humans and Pok\u00e9mon. White Kyurem and Reshiram are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fusion Flare . They're also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Turboblaze as an ability . White Kyurem is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Ice Burn . Black Kyurem Black Kyurem in Overdrive mode Black Kyurem resembles a hybrid version of itself and Zekrom. When transformed into Black Kyurem, its legs are just like the original, but shorter, and the middle toe becomes ice. Its tail resembles that of Zekrom but is attached to the body with three gray parts of the skin. The tail is capable of movement and contains two holes on either side; they are located vertically on Black Kyurem as opposed to White Kyurem. Black Kyurem's torso is noticeably bulkier, and its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from each, which can come out and 'plug into' the aforementioned holes. As Black Kyurem, it has Zekrom's arms, but they are more muscular and without wings on either hand; its left arm and wing are also frozen over. Its neck is the same shape but becomes upright due to adopting Zekrom's posture. The ice covering Kyurem's lower jaws has partially disappeared, allowing it to move its mouth. Like White Kyurem, it also has white eyes with black pupils. It is also worth noting that Black Kyurem has three sharp teeth on either side of its mouth, while White Kyurem only has two. During a battle, Black Kyurem and White Kyurem enter Overdrive mode , and tubes sprout from its back to its tail. In Black Kyurem's case, parts of its right arm and the tip of the horn on the back of its head turn blue, while its tail lights up with electricity. Black Kyurem can use the power of both electricity and ice due to fusing with Zekrom. Black Kyurem can fly using an anti-gravity field through its generator-like tail. Due to Zekrom's influence, Black Kyurem firmly believes in the pursuit of ideals. Due to foreseeing an ideal world, it will fight to protect said future for both humans and Pok\u00e9mon. Black Kyurem and Zekrom are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fusion Bolt . They're also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Teravolt as an ability . Black Kyurem is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Freeze Shock . White Kyurem Kyurem Black Kyurem \u2194 \u2194"

The back of its head, as well as its neck, is covered with fluffy, light blue fur. Keldeo has blue hooves placed backwards, which are capable of ejecting water. Its tail is light blue with white spots and resembles an elaborate feather in a cap. Long ago, a fire started in the Moor of Icirrus because of a war between the humans . In this fire, Keldeo was separated from its parents, but the three Swords of Justice : Cobalion , Terrakion , and Virizion adopted and took care of Keldeo as one of their own. They acted as its parents, and they taught it knowledge and moves for survival. Keldeo eventually grew and even surpassed its mentors. One day, Keldeo took off from the forest with no one knowing why. When the four met again in the Moor of Icirrus, they taught Keldeo the move Secret Sword . When Keldeo left, it started crossing the world and often appeared at beautiful watersides. It travels in order to further improve itself through training. Like Suicune , Keldeo can also walk across the water by ejecting water from its hooves. In Generation V , Sacred Sword was one of its signature moves . Keldeo is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Secret Sword . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Keldeo has two forms: Ordinary Form and Resolute Form. Upon being taught the move Secret Sword by its former mentors , Keldeo has its resolve for battle strengthened, filling its body with power, thus transforming from its Ordinary Form into its Resolute Form. The dark blue protrusions on its head become shorter and lighter in color, now resembling ears. Its horn becomes dark blue and grows larger and ridged. On the side of its head are three feathers colored aqua blue, green, and orange. Keldeo is at its full power when in Resolute Form. It is thought that when Keldeo becomes resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter. Keldeo's jumping capabilities become fast to the point where it is hard to follow. The horn on its forehead is filled with hidden power. The horn can change into a sword that can cut through anything. It is said Keldeo must endure harsh battles in order for the forehead horn to develop, which then awakens its true power. Ordinary Form Resolute Form"

In its Pirouette Forme, it has auburn hair that seems to be stylized in a high bun and red eyes. In both forms, its midriff and eyes match its hair. It is a gender-unknown species. According to artists in Unova , Meloetta's beautiful music and dance inspired many works of art, music, and songs. This made the Pok\u00e9mon popular among both musicians and dancers. Meloetta's melody has a special vocalization method. Meloetta's melody can control the feelings of those who hear it. It can make both humans and Pok\u00e9mon feel happy or sad through this method. The song can also unseal ancient ruins such as the Abyssal Ruins . At one point, Meloetta can lose its signature melody and ability to dance should the world be filled with sorrow. Like many other Legendary and Mythical Pok\u00e9mon , Meloetta is capable of flying and temporarily turning invisible. Meloetta's song can be channeled to summon and control the original three forces of nature Pok\u00e9mon in connection with the Reveal Glass . However, this process can cause Meloetta agonizing pain in the process. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Meloetta has two forms:\nAria Forme and Pirouette Forme.

It has thin arms with overlapping segments. Each arm ends with a single, pointed claw from which it can spin a sticky string to create structures. There is a gray circle on each shoulder and a gray band around its abdomen. Its segmented legs each end with a large, upward-curving claw. Genesect producing a silk-like substance from its claw Genesect was revived from a Fossil and technologically enhanced by Team Plasma to create the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon ever. N had the project canceled and the P2 Laboratory closed because he felt that Pok\u00e9mon, who he thought to be perfect beings, would lose their beauty if modified by science. However, Scientist Dudley kept working on it, angry that N denied his talent. This scientist reconstructed Genesect and installed the cannon on its back. According to a Hiker in Ambrette Town 's Fossil Lab, there is a rumor that Genesect can be found in Glittering Cave . By folding up its limbs and connecting its head to the cannon on its back, Genesect assumes a disk-like form known as the high-speed flight configuration (Japanese: \u9ad8 \u901f \u98db \u884c \u5f62 \u614b K\u014dsoku Hik\u014d Keitai , \"high-speed flight configuration\"), allowing it to fly at remarkable speeds. As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened , Genesect can breathe in outer space. In the movie, it can also produce a sticky silk-like substance that rapidly hardens into brownish stone-like substance. It uses that material to create its nest. The movie also shows that one Genesect may lead the others of its group, being even capable of controlling them to follow its orders. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Genesect has four alternate forms determined by the Drive it holds: Shock Drive, Burn Drive, Chill Drive, and Douse Drive.

It has a stocky build with a round belly, short legs, and long arms with large paws. Its head and belly are covered in thick white fur, while its lower body, chest, arms, and back are covered in equally thick dark gray fur. A long cape of this dark gray fur hangs down behind its back; in combination with the rest of the dark-furred pattern, this gives the impression that Pangoro is wearing a long coat and trousers. Pangoro's three-fingered paws have shorter, darker fur and are tipped with black claws. It has a blunt snout with a triangular black nose, rounded black ears, prominent fangs in its lower jaw, and black semicircles under its brow that make its eyes indistinguishable. Pangoro likes to carry a thin-stemmed shoot with two leaves in its mouth. This small bamboo shoot is used to sense the movements of those around it. Despite its cantankerous demeanor, Pangoro is kind to those it considers to be its friends and it does not tolerate those who pick on the weak. With arms powerful enough to snap a telephone pole, it charges into battle like a berserker, heedless of any damage it might suffer. Pangoro can destroy a dump truck in one punch and utilizes this strength when pummeling its opponents. Many Trainers find themselves smitten with its lively nature; however, those who wish to train a Pangoro for themselves will have to fight one. It lives to engage in duels with Obstagoon .

On top of its head is a long tuft of fur that curls tightly at the tip. A collar of furry-looking tufts hangs over the edge of the pumpkin. Pumpkaboo becomes active after dark. The holes in its body can glow and illuminate the way for travelers in the dark. It is said that it also carries wandering spirits to the afterlife by storing the spirits in its body. However, its own spirit is trapped in this world. Pumpkaboo can hypnotize and control any humans or Pok\u00e9mon. It does this task by releasing streams of light from the holes in the pumpkin. Pumpkaboo and its evolved form Gourgeist are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Trick-or-Treat . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Pumpkaboo has four separate forms: Small Size, Average Size, Large Size, and Super Size. The size of Pumpkaboo is said to be the product of the number of lost souls that lingered in the area where it was formed. When taking spirits to the afterlife, small Pumpkaboo prefer the spirits of children to those of adults. Supersized Pumpkaboo are very partial to the spirits of people who were of similarly superior proportions.

The eyes are black with X-shaped pupils. There is a short marking on top of its snout and an upward curving horn on each side of its head in place of ears. In Active Mode, its markings, antlers, and trim on its legs are pale gold. Its antlers have branches and bumps in many colors and there are multicolored spots on its back. Xerneas assumes this Mode during battle or when using its power. Xerneas is at full power when in Active Mode. In Neutral Mode, its markings and antlers are instead pale blue and the embellishments on its antlers and spots on its back are a darker blue.

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Zygarde is a green and black Pok\u00e9mon whose form depends on the percentage of Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells it has assembled. Zygarde is responsible for monitoring the ecosystem of the Pok\u00e9mon world for abnormalities, It has been referred to as a \"guardian of the ecosystem\" and \"protector of the ecosystems\" due to this role. It also is capable of reversing the effects of Xerneas 's Fairy Aura and Yveltal 's Dark Aura , thus ensuring the equilibrium of the planet and the cycle of life and death are kept in check. It can also use its Cells in attacks, either shooting them as arrows at its targets, or sending them crawling along the ground towards its targets as waves . It can also fire a powerful energy beam from its mouth at its targets, carving a Z on the ground in the process. Zygarde can fly in a blinding speed in all of its forms. Normally, Zygarde avoids getting involved in conflicts unless the ecosystem is in grave danger. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: XY episode Down to the Fiery Finish! , it was shown that the green color on Zygarde's body had changed to red while under the influence of Team Flare 's Mega Evolution energy weapon. In the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga and in Pok\u00e9mon the Series , it has been referred to as \"Z\".

Both are small, green cell-like blobs that resemble a planarian . Their body can be segmented into three sections: a large, round head, an abdomen with a colored hexagon, and a stubby tail. They have two eyes, though one is larger and has a pupil, and can stand on their tail (a trait most associated with the Core). The difference between a Core and a Cell is subtle: a Core has a black pupil and a red hexagon on its abdomen, while these are both green on a Cell. Zygarde Cells flying towards a Zygarde Core Zygarde Cores have wills of their own, while Cells do not, acting only in accordance to a Core's orders. In any form of Zygarde, the Cores act as brains. The Cells exist in much greater numbers than the Cores and tend to be scattered around the world. On their own, Cores and Cells do not have power to battle and need to be assembled in order to take action. A Zygarde may contain up to five Cores. As depicted throughout Pok\u00e9mon the Series: XY , Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells have the ability to turn invisible. Moreover, it revealed that a Core is able to watch over the ecosystem through the eyes of a Cell, can communicate telepathically with other Cores, and does not need to eat, instead absorbing sunlight for sustenance. As depicted in Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series , Cells are capable of transmitting what they see to anyone Zygarde wishes. Zygarde Core Zygarde Cell 10% Forme The 10% Forme resembles a canine and has impressive speed Zygarde 10% Forme is a relatively small canine Pok\u00e9mon. Its body is primarily black, though its neck, muzzle, mouth, eyebrows, and left front paw are green. Additionally, it has two green hexagons on its chest and a single one on its rear. From its neck, a green ribbon-like extension comes out, next to an elongated red hexagon, giving the impression of a leash and dog tag, respectively. Its eyes are white hexagons with no discernible pupils, and there is a thin white line on its forehead. Its mouth is fitted with razor-sharp fangs. On each of its legs are black hexagonal extensions: two on the back of each elbow, one behind each knee, and two on each hip. One of the hip extensions is longer than the other on each hip. Zygarde 10% Forme is created when a single Zygarde Core combines with only a tenth of the total Cells. It is skilled at close range combat, overwhelming its opponents with its sharp fangs. It is also capable of running at speeds greater than 60 miles per hour (100 kilometers per hour). Since it has just one Core, it is able to act separately from Zygarde's 50% Forme, which comprises its main body, for a only short time before separating. Zygarde can wrap its \"leash\" around the arm of those it trusts, however, they can't remove it at will, which might cause them to be pulled when Zygarde runs. The 10% Forme is assumed in cases of emergency. 50% Forme Zygarde 50% Forme is a large serpentine Pok\u00e9mon. Most of its back, head, and neck are black, while the underbelly and the tip of its tail are green. Its eyes are made of four green hexagons, similar to an insect with compound eyes , and there is a thin, white line down the center of its face. Across the back of its neck is a large frill made of five long, flat protrusions that each have two small, green hexagons on them. There are three short tendrils on either side of its chest; they are black on the right and green on the left. Its tail also ends in five tendrils. It has many small, green hexagon markings on its body capable of glowing. Zygarde 50% Forme is assembled from half of its Cores and Cells reuniting. Despite being at only half of its possible total, its power is capable of overwhelming anyone who stands in its way. The 50% Forme is known to be both ruthless and merciless. As seen in Down to the Fiery Finish! , Zygarde 50% Forme can summon and control massive roots, which it can use to attack and cover areas. Complete Forme Zygarde Complete Forme's complex biology Zygarde Complete Form is a large humanoid Pok\u00e9mon. There are several flat protrusions around its head and triangular protrusions around its neck. These protrusions create a crown shape. On its face are three white hexagonal marks: one in the middle of its forehead with a line through it and two that act as eyes. There are an additional five green hexagons on its face: four along the bottom and one in the middle of a short protrusion on top. Each shoulder has two serpentine wings protruding from it. The wings all have an undulating pattern and a hexagon near the tip: blue on the right side and red on the left. There are multiple white protrusions on its body: three on each hand acting as claws, one on each knee, and one and the front of each foot. Additionally, there are green hexagons surrounding its wrists and two under the white protrusions on its knees and feet. Its abdomen has a vertical, hexagonal pattern with a thin, white line on either side. Across its chest is a thin, zigzagging mouth that when opened, reveals five hexagons colored red, orange, white, cyan, and blue, respectively. It has a long tail similar to Zygarde 50% Forme's body. Zygarde Complete Forme is created when 100% of its Cells and Cores are gathered. It is said to be Zygarde's perfected form and is specialized for battle, allowing it to fight at full power and complete its duty of protecting the Pok\u00e9mon ecosystem. Zygarde Complete Forme uses this overwhelming power to suppress those who willingly endanger the ecosystem. Zygarde Complete Forme contains separate Cores for each of its wings and its tail. In this case, each Core can make decisions and act independently of the others. The Zygarde Cores can freely change the shapes of the four wings and tail for a variety of roles. Notably in Forming a More Perfect Union! , Zygarde is shown using the mouths of its tail and wings to attack with energy beams, propel itself, as well as restoring an unbalanced ecosystem back to normal. The zigzagging mouth on its chest can radiate enough high-powered energy to destroy everything around it, even firing energy beams from within it. This form only appears to neutralize huge threats to the ecosystem, such as Lysandre 's 50% Zygarde-like construct and Ultra Necrozma . The Complete Forme is powerful enough to overwhelm even Xerneas and Yveltal . \u2191 Legendary and Mythical Guidebook: Deluxe Edition :\u00a0: \"It is said this Legendary Pok\u00e9mon is a guardian of the ecosystem.\" \u2191 | Zygarde (Archived) \u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon site | Zygarde's Cores and Cells ( archive ) \u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon Site | Zygarde 10% Forme ( archive ) \u2191 | 50% Forme Zygarde (Archived) \u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon site | Zygarde Complete Forme ( archive ) \u2191 https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/"

Around its neck is a golden, half-circlet with a pink diamond in the center. Its head is gray with purple eyes that have red sclerae and pointed ears. On top of its head is a collection of pink crystals forming a headdress. There are four spike-like crystals along the top, a long crystal on either side hanging downward, and a large circular centerpiece on its forehead. There is a small golden piece hanging off the center crystal and a small pink diamond embedded in the back of its head. Diancie is born from a Carbink that undergoes a mysterious mutation. It can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air. Diancie uses these diamonds to both attack and defend itself . Diancie is also said to be one of the most beautiful Pok\u00e9mon seen in the world, and its pink, glimmering body has been called one of the loveliest sights possible. Diancie is found living in underground caves filled with diamonds such as the Diamond Domain , a crystal kingdom where it reigns as queen over many Carbink, as it has occasionally been seen traveling or living with others.

On the back, both the dress and the crystals are longer, and additional, smaller crystals are suspended from the tips of the larger ones. The tips of the circlet around its neck curve outward and there is an additional half-circlet around its waist. The centerpiece of its headdress is now heart-shaped, and the remaining crystals are slightly smaller. The crystals hanging from the sides of its head have additional crystals suspended from the tips, and there is an additional hanging crystal on the back of its head. The diamond on the back of its head becomes rounded and two smaller gems form at the lower corners. Two ribbon-like structures grow from these additional gems; each ribbon has two small crystals suspended from the tips. The head diamond measures over 2,000 carats. Thanks to the Mega Evolution energy , Diancie's manipulation over diamonds has grown so much, that Mega Diancie can now create a sword out of them during battle. Due to the impurities on the surface of body having fallen away, Mega Diancie can now shine so brilliantly that when reflecting light, one cannot look directly at it.

It is heavily implied to be the one causing many of the Mirage spots in the Hoenn region . As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Masters EX , Hoopa can even bring people and Pok\u00e9mon from alternate timelines . Hoopa is also known to like donuts. Hoopa's lair is rumored to be located inside an hidden desert oasis. This lair contains many objects and treasures Hoopa obtained over the years, claiming as its own. Hoopa's lair is believed to contain mountains of gold and silver treasures it stole from ancient kings and wealthy land barons. To the present day, no one has ever found Hoopa's lair due to how well hidden it is. Hoopa can be very vengeful to those who attempt to manipulate it for its unqiue power. According to one tale, it punished an organization by transporting their individual objects before moving their headquarter to the middle of the desert. This incident terrified the organization to the point of disbanding. Hoopa Confined is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Hyperspace Hole . Forms [ edit | edit source ] A ring Mirage spot in Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire Hoopa has two forms: Hoopa Confined and Hoopa Unbound. Hoopa Unbound is a large, bipedal Pok\u00e9mon with six arms. It is mostly light blue with purple hair. The ponytail on its head is larger and bushier and held in place by two golden rings. Its hair now covers its chin, where it forms a pointed beard, and the back of its neck. The horns are less curved and have spiky purple hair around the bases. There are three gold rings on each horn: two around the base and one around the middle. It has yellow eyes white sclerae, a pointed, dark gray nose, a small hole inside of the ring-marking on its forehead, and prominent fangs in the back of its lower jaw. Similar to Hoopa Confined, its arms are disconnected and float next to its body. Instead of a small, gold spike the arms now have large, dark gray spikes and appear from holes along the sides of its body. Each arm has three fingers with dark gray claws, a gold ring around the wrist, and a gold ring around the base. Several tufts of purple hair surround its torso and a gold ring encircles a hole in the center of its chest. Another large gold ring encircles its waist and there are small tufts of hair poking out from underneath it. There is a purple stripe that widens at the knee down each leg and two gold rings around each ankle. The tips of its feet are gold and curl upward. Additionally, this form has a tail with a purple stripe along the top and an arrow-shaped tip. Hoopa Unbound is tied with Mega Gyarados as the tallest Dark type. Hoopa Unbound is said to be Hoopa's true form and is said to have a humongous amount of power. Hoopa is at full power in its Unbound Form, it can increase the size of its six rings to grow multiple miles in length. These massive rings are capable of transporting entire islands through its hoops. Hoopa Unbound is capable of bending dimensions on an even more powerful scale. Hoopa Unbound can summon powerful Legendary Pok\u00e9mon through its hoops. It can even use its rage to drive Legendary Pok\u00e9mon berserk. However, this has the dangerous side effect of creating a space-time distortion that'll destroy the area where they were summoned as depicted in Hoopa and the Clash of Ages . One legend stated that it greedily teleported an entire castle from Kalos 3,000 years ago to obtain a treasure hidden within it. Hoopa can remain in its Unbound form for only three days, until its power is sealed back into the Prison Bottle, reverting itself to its Confined Form. Hoopa Unbound is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning and using the move Hyperspace Fury .

Its body is divided into three segments: a considerably larger front portion that has a hunched back, a thin, blue waist, and smaller hips that resemble its front portion. On its chest are four yellow, diamond-shaped bumps. There is a thin, yellow band around each of its leg joints and the lower, maroon portions of its legs are larger than the thin, blue upper portions. Each ankle has a short, blunt growth, while each foot has three yellow claws. Volcanion has a short, tapering tail with a slightly shorter blue bump along the top. On the back of the front portion of its body are two arm-like cannons. These cannons are normally held together and form a ring around the back. Each cannon is separated into three segments by bright blue lines and each segment has a single blue dot and a short, blunt growth. The topmost segments also have four small, yellow bumps around the ends. Volcanion has an organ that allows it to vaporize the water it absorbs instantly with extremely high temperatures. The arms on Volcanion's back expel the resulting steam from inside its body, allowing it to disappear into the dense fog. It can expel steam of superbly high pressure and has the ability to blow away mountains. Volcanion is capable of creating explosive shockwaves . This power also allows Volcanion to gouge out the earth and changing the land by reshaping it. It's said to live in mountains where humans do not tread. Volcanion can run out of water within its body to use, as depicted in the movie Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel . When it does, a sound similar to a bell is heard, the lines and dots on its cannons turn red, and it is unable to use any Water-type moves until it refills its water supply from another source.

Most of its plumage, including its heart-shaped facial disc , is white, but it has dark brown feathers covering its head, shoulders, and back. Its large eyes contain dark irises and usually appear closed. It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut ; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward. This alert Pok\u00e9mon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A Trainer who helps Dartrix through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength. Conversely, Dartrix will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom. In Hisui , Dartrix tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, Dartrix becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian Decidueye , gaining the Fighting type instead of the Ghost type.

In the center of its chest is a reddish-orange X shape formed by dead leaves. Extending from its hood are two vines that, when pulled, close the hood further over Decidueye's face and improves its focus. The vines can also be used as bowstrings. While this Pok\u00e9mon is cool and cautious by nature, it begins to panic if surprised. It can hide from opponents by masking its presence, allowing it to attack unaware foes.

On its back, a stripe of reddish orange fur runs down its spine, with other two smaller horizontal stripes going across it. A similar fur pattern is seen on Torracat's face, though now it moreso resembles an upside-down double cross: the vertical stripe extends up from its head, forming a short cowlick , and the lowest horizontal stripes tilt upwards into a V-shape above its eyes, forming its eyebrows. Its eyes have yellow irises and black pupils with a red tint at the bottom and are heavily outlined in black fur. Its ears are pointed up and have light gray fur at the base. It has a short muzzle, a tiny triangular white nose, and tufts of fur sprouting from each of its cheeks, which make up its mane. Its tail is thicker the farther away from the body and ends in several tufts of fur, giving the impression it has blown up. Its forelegs are more developed than its hind legs, capable of bending iron with a single blow. Each paw has three toes, with the front ones being larger and ending on short black claws. On its tail and legs, there are two rings of opposite-colored fur. Hanging from Torracat's neck is a round, bell-like organ, which is yellow with an orange core. This fiery organ is actually Torracat's flame sac, which produces the flames it uses to attack; when it does so, the organ sometimes flares with wing-like projections to the sides. The fire bell responds to Torracat's emotions, blazing hotter according to its spirits, and rings brightly whenever it spews fire or in the heat of battle. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Exhibition Unmasked! , its fire bell is also capable of absorbing flames from outside sources and converting them into its own power. In addition, Torracat's mane acts as a sensory organ, allowing it to navigate in darkness and sense hidden foes. It is also an indicator of its wellbeing, standing on end when it is in a good mood and lying flat when it is not feeling well. Torracat loves to battle, and its relentless onslaught causes others to lose the will to fight. Outside of battle, it sometimes behaves like a spoiled child in front of its Trainer and other Pok\u00e9mon, showcasing a more affectionate side to itself in comparison to its pre-evolved form .

The upper half of its muzzle and the top and back of its head are black. A thin red stripe runs vertically along its head to its snout, where it splits into a V-shape over its eyes. Its torso is gray with several black stripes and seems to resemble a wrestler's tank top; the front and back both have a single vertical stripe up the center, crossed by two horizontal lines. Around Incineroar's waist is a belt formed from flames that somewhat resembles a championship wrestling belt. In the front center is a small, yellow flame shape. The arms, legs, and tail are all red with black stripes forming bands around them. The arms have three stripes, spiky tufts of black fur over the shoulders, and large five-fingered hands with white claws and a single light red pad on the palm. Its legs have only two stripes and simple three-toed paws, and the tail has one stripe and a tuft of spiky black fur around the tip. Incineroar's flame belt is produced from within its body and bursts from its navel and waist as its fighting spirit rises. In addition to spewing fire from its navel, it uses ferocious kicks and punches. Incineroar is an expert on no-holds-barred battles. The flames from its navel can reach a temperature of up to 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. This Pok\u00e9mon disregards the safety of its opponents and on-lookers, sometimes striking the opposing Trainer with attacks. Incineroar usually attacks first by unleashing both ferocious punches and flinging furious kick combos and then finishing the opponent by spewing fire from its navel. It is a violent Pok\u00e9mon with rough, aggressive, and egotistical behavior. It will sometimes ignore its Trainer's orders when it is not in the mood to listen. Despite this, it finds fighting unworthy opponents boring and gets motivated to fight a challenging one. Weak or injured opponents also cause them to lose the desire to fight, which others sometimes use to their advantage. It also values the attention of the crowd as Incineroar's spirit goes up while the crowd is excited or falters when the crowd is bored. When Incineroar's fighting spirit rises, so does the temperature around its navel waist. While it tends to act like a heel , Incineroar is very happy internally when receiving the admiration of children or young Pok\u00e9mon.

Toucannon is an avian Pok\u00e9mon with black feathers and a prominent beak similar to a toucan , with the upper part being larger than the lower part, or the mandible. There are gases inside its beak, which can ignite and launch seeds with enough force to shatter boulders. Additionally, its temperature can exceed 212 \u00b0F (100 \u00b0C) and cause severe burns on contact. Toucannon can use this beak to warm up eggs, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon episode First Catch in Alola, Ketchum-Style! . Except for the black tip on the upper part, Toucannon's beak can change colors as it heats up, although it normally has four bands of red, orange, and yellow at the top, and solid red on the mandible. As Toucannon heats up its beak, the bands on the upper beak glow and turn red (or sometimes bright yellow, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Keeping Your Eyes on the Ball! ) one-by-one, from tip to base. When its beak cools down, both of its parts are momentarily solid yellow, before resuming their normal colorations. Around the base of the beak is a thin black band with two extensions into the upper jaw similar to nostrils. There is a white marking covering Toucannon's chin and chest, and a half-circle, yellow marking on each cheek. Toucannon has dark blue eyes, light blue eyelids, and jagged, gray eyebrows. It has a long tail with a spiky ruff of red feathers around the base, and spindly blue legs. Each foot has two forward-facing toes with black talons and two rear-facing toes with no visible claws. Its tail seems to be bent specifically for the purpose of holding it momentarily, as it can stand on it for short periods, possibly as a brace when firing seeds. In order to communicate, Toucannon strike each other with their beaks. The number and strength of the hits reflect how it is feeling. Toucannon is well known for forming loving couples, which makes it a common good luck charm at weddings. Toucannon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Beak Blast .

It has a white underbelly that extends up around its muzzle and eyes in a mask-like marking. It has pointed ears with dark brown tips and pink insides, big blue eyes, and a triangular, dark brown nose. There are four sharp fangs in its mouth: two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. Large tufts of brown fur extend from the sides of its head; three tufts on each side. A bushy, white mane covers its neck. Four dark brown rocks poke out of its mane, creating a shape similar to a stylized sun. The rocks are said to be razor-sharp. The lower portions of this form's legs are white, and each foot has three dark brown claws. It also has a long, fluffy white tail. The Midday Form has a calm, collected, and cautious personality. In order to avoid needless fighting, the Midday Form prefers to live alone and does not form a pack with others of its kind. However, it is a fiercely loyal partner to Trainers that accept it during its unruly stage. In battle, it darts past opponents while attacking them with the rocks in its mane. These swift movements leave many foes bewildered and backed into a corner. It always aims for the foes' weak spot using its fangs. Broken fragments of its stone mane are considered good luck. Midnight Form In its Midnight Form, Lycanroc instead resembles a slouched, bipedal wolf or werewolf. It has short red fur with white on its lower legs and a white streak that covers its face, underbelly, and tail. It has pointed, button ears with black tips, three large tufts of fur on each side of its face, a triangular black nose, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. While the sclerae, irises, and pupils of its eye are visible, they all glow a pinkish red and no distinctive colors are visible. A mane of fur covers its back and shoulders, sweeping forward over its head to form a crescent moon shape. On either side of its body, just below the shoulders, two small rocks resembling claws poke out of the mane. A single, bigger stone projects out of the front of the mane over its head. Each of this form's paws has three black claws, and it has a stubby tail covered in long fur. In contrast to its Midday Form, Lycanroc's Midnight Form is thrilled by battling and becomes more excited the stronger its opponent. This excitement is what causes its eyes to glow. The Midnight Form is known to be reckless along with extremely vicious temper. Its strategy consists of closing in on its opponent and encouraging attack, then countering with a powerful blow that knocks out its opponent. The full force of its headbutts can destroy giant boulders. Trainers that can draw out its power earn its trust, but it despises those that it disagrees with or who try to force it to fight. Dusk Form In its Dusk Form, Lycanroc resembles a combination of its Midday and Midnight Forms. Its body is similar to Midday Form with the same white color except with orange-gold fur. It retains the three brown claws for all four feet. The white fluffy mane resembles a sun with part of the crescent moon. It also has four rocks around its neck like a sun as well along with a single, bigger stone coming from the mane over its head. Its face resembles Midday Form Lycanroc's but is orange-gold with bright green eyes,  which can change to bright glowing red when angry or attacking. The Dusk Form Lycanroc shares traits from the previous two forms. Its stance, calm demeanor, and loyal nature are shared with the Midday Form. However, it also shares the Midnight Form's fighting spirit, including the red, glowing eyes at the moment of attack. Dusk Form Lycanroc never barks, unlike its two other forms. Upon entering battle, Lycanroc will relentlessly drive its opponents into a corner. Due to only evolving at sunset, the Dusk Form is considered the rarest of the three forms. The Dusk Form of Lycanroc is rather difficult to train due to its temperamental nature. Because of this, Dusk Form Lycanroc is considered the most troublesome of its three forms.

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Wishiwashi is a fishlike Pok\u00e9mon . It has two different forms depending on the situation. In its Solo Form, Wishiwashi resembles a small fish. It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pok\u00e9mon is both the shortest and lightest Water-type . An individual Wishiwashi is small, weak, and notably tasty. As a result Wishiwashi has numerous natural predators, including humans , Dewgong , Wailmer , Wailord , Wingull , and Pelipper . While Wishiwashi are known to move in schools, they're more often seen alone. Wishiwashi also gather when confronting opponents. It can call on its friends by shining its eyes seen as an SOS signal almost 25 miles (40 kilometers) away. Wishiwashi is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Schooling as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Wishiwashi has two interchangeable forms: Solo Form and School Form. In its School Form, Wishiwashi resembles a large fish roughly formed from various smaller fish with glowing eyes. Starting with its head, its body is divided into four bands that each become a slightly darker shade of blue. A ring of bright blue glowing spots lines the front edge of the two middle bands. The centers of its \"eyes\" are formed by a single white fish with glowing eyes for pupils. Surrounding the white fish is a dark blue recess, and at the rear edge of the \"eye\" is a raised white area for eyelids. Above each eye is a single, dark blue fish shape. Wishiwashi's mouth gapes wide open, apparently unable to close fully due to gaps on each side. Its lips in the front are lined with glowing spots, and many more spots dot the inside of its mouth. On each side of the School Form's body, in the second band, there is a pair of dark blue fish-shaped recesses. Wishiwashi can fire fish-shaped torpedoes from this area. Its pectoral fins are the same color as its head and have three finger-like projections. There are glowing spots at the base of each \"finger\" and at the base of the fins themselves. On top of its head are two short projections shaped like fishtails, one behind the other. Additionally, Wishiwashi has a large dorsal fin that is darker around the base and has two glowing spots at the tip. The third section of its body has a ring of four spike-like fins around it. Three spikes encircle the tip of its tail, each with two glowing dots at the base. Dark fish shapes float freely a short distance from the end of each spike, all with two more dots on them. Finally, the tip of its tail is a rounded teardrop shape with a single dot on each side. The people of Alola and Galar also fear Wishiwashi and call it the \"demon of the sea\" due to its School Form. Even the fearsome Gyarados and Wailord are known to flee from it when it enters School Form. Wishiwashi assumes this form whenever a Wishiwashi is in danger or is bullied. Wishiwashi can concentrate their powers when assembled. The School Form's Water Gun is said to be more powerful than a Hydro Pump move. Should it get wounded in School Form, Wishiwashi will split into a regular school before fleeing. A special school of Wishiwashi in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for Lana 's trial in Brooklet Hill . These Wishiwashi possess Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura.

It has blue eyes with yellow pupils and sclerae, and three pointed teeth. The body consists of two sections; the top section is slightly smaller and overlaps the lower. On top of its head is a starfish-like collection of ten tentacles. All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center. Mareanie is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head. The lost limbs have a very bitter, astringent flavor, and thus they cannot be eaten as food. Bruxish feeds on Mareanie, which in turn eats the branches of Corsola \u2014 except in Galar , where it has not yet learned to prey on them. Mareanie also eats broken-off Pincurchin spines, despite the risk of getting electrocuted. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon episode, The Sun, the Scare, the Secret Lair! , it is seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines. The poison causes numbness and intense itching. Mareanie live in groups and are found in beaches and the bottom of oceans.

Its head is dark blue on top, near where its legs connect. This part of its body is typically suspended in the air due to the length of its legs. The legs themselves are light blue on top and dark blue on the undersides. The legs are filled with spines, which can protrude towards the outer leg or retract into the inner leg. The inner spines are purplish pink, and when they are present, the outer spines sink back into its legs, and vice versa. The tip of each leg has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top. Toxapex uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola . They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions , trapping its body heat to keep it warm. Toxapex's spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours (3 days), even to Pok\u00e9mon as large as Wailord . Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead. Bruxish is its natural enemy.

Black bangs hang over its face before turning into a stiff mane along its neck. Additionally, it has a short, black tail. Thick, cream-colored mud surrounds each black hoof. Mudbray can be kept happy by giving it time to frolic in and consume mud. Mudbray's diet consists of eating dirt in order to create mud. It then regurgitates the mud in order to cover itself in it. Mudbray's mud won't dry out, even when exposed to the sun for long periods of time. Denying it this will cause it to become stressed and disobey its Trainer. This Pok\u00e9mon boasts immense strength for its size and is able to drag or carry loads up to fifty times its own weight. Mudbray are known to be skilled at using mud. The mud that collects around its hooves enhances its grip and power. Notably, it allows Mudbray to travel rough terrains without slipping. Because it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it was believed for a time to run wild only in Alola . Despite this, Mudbray have been seen roaming in Galar and Paldea , suggesting that its population is slowly recovering from near extinction.

Around its hooves is a protective coating of red mud, which has three notches around the bottom. Mudsdale is known for both its powerful body and emotional fortitude, which prevents it from becoming agitated. Regardless of the trouble it is in, it will never cry out and will defeat opponents with a single blow. The mud around its legs gives its kicks extra force; one kick can turn a car or large truck into a scrap pile. When galloping, its hooves can dig holes in asphalt. While it is not swift, it has excellent stamina and can continue on for three days and three nights while dragging over 10 tons. It will mix dirt and saliva to create a special mud with resistance to both wind and water. The mud is also harder than even stone.

        "name": "Type: Null",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Type: Null is a quadrupedal, chimeric Pok\u00e9mon with traits from a variety of creatures. Its head is enclosed in a brown helmet with green markings, designed to suppress its power to stable levels. The helmet is extremely heavy and hinders its agility. The helmet has a large jaw piece that wraps around the front with large, round hinges on the side. Each hinge is covered by a green X-shaped marking. The name of the Pok\u00e9mon, as it wears the helmet, is called Null meaning nothing. Small gray eyes can be seen from within rectangular black holes on the front, and there are two pointed ears on the top. Around the base is a collar with four protruding vanes that are tipped with a three-way spike. This collar has a thin green line between the vanes, and each vane has a green hexagon near the end. An axe-like blade with a band around the middle extends backward from the top of the helmet. The front tip of the blade has a small, silver spike that hooks downward. A mane of gray fur hangs from below Type: Null's helmet and covers its shoulders and chest. Most of its torso and legs is covered in short black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and on the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a light blue fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes. Spoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details. Type: Null was created by the Aether Foundation as part of the beast killer project . It was designed to be an \"Anti- UB Fighting life-form\", a weapon created to fight against the Ultra Beasts. Also known as \" beast killer \", Type: Null was developed with cells taken from all known Pok\u00e9mon types . This was done with the intention of giving it the ability to shift between types by holding a corresponding memory , an ability originally inspired by the myths researched at Canalave Library . This ability led the Aether Foundation to name it \"Type: Full\". Three known models of Type: Full were created, but all three rejected the RKS System and went berserk. Faba had created limiter helmets for these Pok\u00e9mon, and after being subdued, the three Type: Full were given the helmets to lessen the effects of the RKS System's rejection and were put into permanent cryogenic stasis. Thus, the beast killer project was deemed a failure, and the creature's name changed to Type: Null. At some point before the events of Generation VII , Gladion was able to free one of the Type: Null, which he adopted as his own in the hopes of finding a way to undo the effects of the limiter helmet and allow it to use the RKS System. Gladion would eventually rediscover its Evolution, Type: Full, renaming it as Silvally . When Type: Null evolves into Silvally, it breaks the helmet it wears in the process. Prior to the events of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield , a new Type: Null is created in the Galar region, apparently by Macro Cosmos by utilizing research notes stolen from Alola . Being created to hunt down Ultra Beasts, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon and Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Type: Null can feel the appearance of Ultra Beasts and the opening of Ultra Wormholes .

It has a mammalian head with mechanical parts. Covering most of its head and neck is a thick, silver mane that extends down over its chest. Its blunt snout is metallic on the bridge of its nose and upper jaw. Silvally has a triangular black nose framed by three red lines, pointed ears with bright pink and black insides, one visible fang on each side of its lower jaw, and a slight overbite. Its eyes are bright silver, have no visible pupils, and appear to be surrounded by an empty, black space. On each side of its head is a circular, metallic drive , with a white circle crossed by a metal line. On top of its head is a large, axe-like fur or feather crest. The tip of the crest has a hooked, metallic piece, while the back has three white feathers. Silvally's lower body is mostly covered in short, black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a white fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes. Silvally's disk drive opening up for a Fighting - type Memory Once Type: Null finds a trusted partner and forms a powerful bond with them, it gains the strength and willpower needed to destroy its control mask and finally evolve into its original form, Silvally. After its Evolution, it reactivates its RKS System , gaining the ability to change its type through the Memories created by the Aether Foundation ; this ability was based on the powers of a certain Pok\u00e9mon depicted in myths . Additionally, Silvally's speed and senses are increased due to Evolution. It was created as part of the beast killer project as an \"Anti- UB Fighting life-form\", however, the project was deemed a failure and a control helmet was built to seal away its power, turning it into Type: Null. It reverts back to its natural, wild temperament, but it is still extremely loyal to its Trainer , and it will even risk its own life in its partner's defense . Gladion was the one who coined Silvally\u2019s name, but when it was created, it was named as \"Type: Full\" due to its ability to change between all types.

When it sheds its rocky coating, its exposed core form is both the lightest Rock-type and Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon. Both of its forms tie with Carbink and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type . In its Meteor Form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place. When its core is exposed, Minior loses its rocky shell. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth is a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body. The colors of Minior's forms are determined by the composition of the dust it consumes. Minior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. When touched in Meteor Form, Minior will react when touched or called to, it is unknown if these responses indicate its consciousness. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Pok\u00e9 Ball quickly enough. Despite this, many fallen Minior will attempt to return to space, sadly being unable to return to space. Despite their wish to return home, all they can do is fade away without their shells. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's core often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories. While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pok\u00e9mon such as Rayquaza . Minior's diet consists of eating dust. Places where Minior falls are few, Alola being one of them. Minior is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Shields Down as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Minior's shell is broken off when it gets too heavy, exposing its core Minior has two forms: Meteor Form and the seven colored forms for its core that are otherwise identical.

There is a small ruff of longer, gray fur around its neck. Each hand is black with five short fingers, and it has three black claws and a black paw pad on each foot. Its underbelly is white, as is its short, fluffy tail. Komala is usually seen holding a short wooden log, which it is given at birth. The log is typically a light brown with darker, oval markings all over it. The ends of the log are tan with the growth rings visible. This Pok\u00e9mon stays asleep from birth to death, staying this way because of its diet of certain leaves containing poison only Komala can break down, which induces sedative properties. While its expression sometimes changes as if it is aware of its surroundings, this appears to be a result of its dreams instead. It is able to eat, travel, and even battle without waking. If the log pillow it clings to is removed, it will be unable to sleep well and thrash wildly. However, it will sometimes cling to the arm of a Trainer it trusts. During a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether. According to ancient people, if a small amount of the saliva created when it eats leaves is watered down and ingested, one will be able to sleep well. This diluted saliva was also historically used as an anesthetic for surgeries. Hypno has been known to hunt this Pok\u00e9mon in Alola , appearing to prefer them over humans.

On top of its head is an additional shell with many points around the brim. This extra shell has a black center, yellow in the middle, and a red outer rim. Its eyes have black markings around the bottom, and it has a tubular, yellow snout with a single, large nostril. Turtonator has a wide mouth with the lower lip marked by a jagged yellow line extending from its nose. On each side of Turtonator's long neck are two short, triangular projections. Its front legs have mitten-like hands, while its hind feet have claw-like red growths around them. Most of its tail is also covered by red plating, which has fin-like projections. The shell that encases its body has a red underside with a star-shaped, yellow-rimmed hole in the center. The back of the shell has a yellow center with several spikes: four large spikes with red bases form a star shape in the center with four smaller spikes around them. This Pok\u00e9mon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, Turtonator also feeds on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. This diet also makes Turtonator's feces dangerously explosive. The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest. This orifice also acts as Turtonator's weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils.

Scattered across its back are 14 fur spikes that appear as yellow and brown triangular markings. When attacking, surprised, or agitated, these spikes will stand straight up. There is a tail-like needle on the back of its head. The needle is gray with a yellow tip and is shaped like a lightning bolt. Additionally, it has stubby arms and legs. When Togedemaru's spines are out, its cheek marks sometimes look like electrical outlets. Togedemaru uses the needle on top of its head to attract and gather electricity. Groups can be seen gathered with their needles standing upright, waiting to be struck by lightning on stormy days to make up for its somewhat limited electric capacity. Some Trainers use its ability to absorb electricity as a strategy in battle. The opponent is coaxed into unleashing an Electric-type attack, and then has that power turned against it.

Its eyes are beady black through the holes in the body of its disguise however, as seen in the animated series, its eyes are actually purple. Fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body is visible under the hem as well. Occasionally, it will also extend a long, black claw-like appendage from under its rag. When angered, its eyes will glow yellow. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu . The cloth is yellow with black-tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. The rag's head is hollow and can be used to store objects. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backward, revealing Mimikyu's ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within. A lonely Pok\u00e9mon, Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. It is unknown what Mimikyu's true appearance looks like. However, glimpses of it are seen, such as its claw, its underside, and its eyes. Since this Pok\u00e9mon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Because of this, Mimikyu will become agitated and violently stop anyone from attempting to look underneath its rag. Mimikyu's disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people. It uses the disguise to bond more with humans and other Pok\u00e9mon. Unfortunately, this attempt makes its disguise look more creepy. Until recent times, Mimikyu was initially thought by humans to be just a ghost wearing a cloth. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Mimikyu mimics Pikachu to the point it even sleeps similar to it. Its relationship to Pikachu can vary between individuals and canons , with some being antagonistic, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon , or can be friendly, as shown in the short, A Mimikyu Bedtime Story .

Mimikyu changes into its Busted Form when it is hit by an attack and its neck breaks, causing it to slump over and no longer convincingly resemble a Pikachu. Ordinarily, the rag it wears allows Mimikyu to avoid attacks. Mimikyu will attempt to keep up its disguise, even if its rag is broken. However, if its rag does get damaged or its neck gets broken, it will spend all night patching it in front of a mirror as if its life depends on it. Repairing the rag correctly is often difficult for Mimikyu, so it cries a lot on the inside. It then seeks revenge on the one that damaged it, fearing that its true identity could have been exposed. Unforgiving, Mimikyu will take down the culprit at the risk of costing its own life in the process. Mimikyu will never forget the person who damaged its rag for as long as it is still alive.

Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious. Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie , are ground into mush and eaten. Toxapex is a rival of Bruxish in warm ocean currents.

        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Kommo-o is a bipedal, reptilian Pok\u00e9mon covered in scaly armor. Most of its body is gray with some lighter gray areas as well as yellow and red markings. It has a rounded, beak-ish snout and small eyes nearly hidden under its head armor. On the tip of its snout is a patch of pale gray and both the upper and lower jaws have a small, tooth-like spike on each side. The top of its head is covered by an elaborate arrangement of scales. At the front of the headdress is an oval scale, which is yellow with a red heart-shape at the base. On either side of the front scale is a chain of four circular scales; the first three scales are red with yellow trim and the last scale is solid yellow. Three additional chains of plain yellow scales extend from the back of the headdress. Running down the front of its long neck is a line of overlapping scales: one solid gray at the top, three larger gray ones with yellow rims, and one solid yellow scale at the bottom. A thick yellow stripe with a rounded projection in the center runs across its chest. Covering its shoulders are tufts of spiky, white feathers with small, gray scales overlapping them. Four overlapping scales cover the tops of its arms: three are gray with yellow edges and the scales that cover its hands are red with yellow edges. Kommo-o has four scaly chains, all of which consist of four scales, extending from just behind its shoulders. The two foremost chains are made of overlapping scales and have a solid gray scale at the top followed by three scales with yellow edges. The other two chains consist of only solid gray scales and do not appear to overlap. The lower halves of its legs are dark gray and there is a pale gray marking across each knee. Its hands have four yellow claws, while the feet have only three. A long line of slightly raised, pale gray scales runs down the center of its back to about halfway up its tapering tail. Near the tip of its tail are three sets of loose scales that increase in size near the tip. Each set is made up of four separate scales that encircle the tail; the two lower sets are solid yellow, while the set nearest the tip have gray centers. The very tip of its tail is pale gray. Kommo-o, having completed its harsh training, returns to its birthplace to protect Jangmo-o . However, it only watches over them from a distance. The power of this Pok\u00e9mon's uppercut is enough to send foes flying, so simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness. Its scales function as both offensive weapons and defensive shields. Because it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. Weak or cowardly opponents will panic at this sound and flee immediately. Kommo-o also swings the scales on its tail to threaten any enemies it sees. Upon finishing off its prey, Kommo-o will let out a victory howl. Additionally, the metallic sounds made by its comrades celebrating can also be heard all around the area the group is in. While the animated series shows that Kommo-o is capable of bipedal locomotion, the core series games since Generation VIII show that it vastly prefers to walk and run around by knuckle-walking . A special Kommo-o in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for an unmanned trial in Vast Poni Canyon . This Kommo-o possesses Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Kommo-o and completing the trial is a Dragonium Z . Kommo-o is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soul . Kommo-o is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Clangorous Soulblaze . Evolution [ edit | edit source ] Kommo-o evolves from Hakamo-o and is the final form of Jangmo-o .

Extending from the top of its head is a large, orange plume with bristles along the back. There is a yellow marking covering the top bristle and half of the bristle below it. The bottom of this crest goes all the way to its neck, where it divides its face in half and creates a beak-like nose. It has small, blue eyes with yellow markings behind them. The lower half of its body is orange with four pointed projections: one short spine on the front and two short spines in the back, with one longer spine between them. These spines resemble a bird's tail feathers. Its thin arms have round, yellow structures encircling its shoulders. On each arm is a shell that appears to be half of a bird mask, and its hands end in two large claws to create a beak for the mask. The mask itself is mostly yellow with black, orange, and white markings. There are three white triangular markings with black edges on the top of each half of the mask, which create diamond shapes when the mask is closed. The 'eyes' consist of a white diamond connected to a slightly larger orange diamond, which is inside a larger yellow diamond. Each of these shapes is edged in black. On each half of its beak is an orange triangle with a white rim. There are wing-shaped structures on each side, toward the back. Tapu Koko is able to pull the mask together and hide its upper body inside, creating the impression of a stylized rooster . This Pok\u00e9mon is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island . It's known for protecting its home, but it is fickle and will not necessarily help people in need. However, it is very curious and may come to play or battle with people or Pok\u00e9mon that interest it. It is able to store electricity by closing itself inside the shells on its arms. It does this by summoning thunderclouds. It has an explosive temper, but it instantly forgets what enraged it in the first place. Due to this, Tapu Koko has been referred to as a malevolent deity should it get provoked. It can move lightning-fast in order to confuse enemies that fight it. Tapu Koko is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts . As seen in Revealing the Stuff of Legend! , Tapu Koko and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring. Furthermore, in Battling the Beast Within! , it was shown to have the ability to transport others into Ultra Space when working together with another Tapu Koko.

Below each eye is a curved white line and above each is a curved pink line separated into three segments. On its upper body is another, thicker curved white line. Its thin arms have digitless hands and puffy pink bracelets on each wrist. On top of its head is a mass of dark pink, tentacle-like hair. Two longer strands of hair frame its face. Encasing its dark pink lower body and on top of its head is a shell resembling an insect. Tapu Lele's shell is primarily light pink. The portion on top of its head is conical with a white diamond marking in the center and a white half-diamond marking below that. Both diamond shapes are framed in black. The shell around its lower body mirrors these diamond markings and has an additional half-diamond on the back. On each side is a hexagon marking consisting of five dark pink triangles and one light pink triangle all outlined in black. These resemble the compound eyes of many insects. There are also projections on the back of the shell that resemble butterfly wings and a small black bump on the bottom similar to a curled proboscis . When closed, the shell resembles a bug's head with small wings. The people of Akala Island worship Tapu Lele. This guardian of Akala Island is known to scatter glowing scales, which affect others by stimulating and healing their bodies; however, these scales are also dangerous if too many are touched at once. Some consider it to be guilelessly cruel for the way it destroys others as it scatters its scales for its own amusement. This has resulted in Tapu Lele being described as an incarnation of nature, the reason being it does not feel remorse for its cruel actions. An old legend says that Tapu Lele ended a war between Alola 's islands by healing the tired warriors with its scales, but rumors point to a more disturbing truth behind this story. Its strength comes from the energy stored within its shell. If Tapu Lele finds itself at a disadvantage in battle, it will prioritize not outright losing as opposed to trying for a decisive victory. It is said to gain energy from the scent of flowers. Tapu Lele is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts . As seen in Revealing the Stuff of Legend! , Tapu Lele and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.

Under each eye is a red line divided into three segments with a smaller, white line below that. There is a short white line above each eye. In the middle of its face is what appears to be a golden nose similar to a bull's snout. There is a white ring through the nostrils of the nose. On each side of its face is a thick white line that curves upward at the outer tip. There are red rings around its shoulders and golden, cloven hooves at the end of its arms. Its tail is mostly covered in a golden bell with two thin black rings around the top and a wavy black line around the bottom. A tuft of fur is just visible inside the bell. On top of its head is a pair of curved, black horns. Each horn has a thick yellow marking near the tip and half of a wooden shell attached to it. Tapu Bulu's shell is primarily red with white and yellow markings thickly bordered by a muted black. The shell itself resembles a flower or plant when open; when closed, the horns shift to the sides and it takes on the appearance of a bull. The top of each half is slightly thicker than the bottom, which gives the \"bull\" a slightly protruding brow. At the bottom of each half is a white rectangle with a muted black triangle at the bottom. Above the rectangles are two triangular markings; the top triangle slightly overlaps a larger, yellow triangle. Behind and just touching the yellow triangle is a tiny, white rectangle that creates the \"bull's\" eyes. The side has a single, tiny yellow triangle marking. This guardian of Ula'ula Island is able to command vegetation to grow and change shape to its will. Despite its fearsome power, it is largely inactive, leading some to consider it a lazy Pok\u00e9mon. It has a peaceful disposition and does not like to cause unnecessary violence, so it rings the bell on its tail to alert others of its presence. However, it is merciless to those who offend it and it is said to have once repelled thieves from its ruins by swinging trees like clubs.

Each finger is tipped with a purple claw. On the front of its lower body is a light blue, fin-like projection with three spikes. It also has light blue fins on top of its head that resemble long, flowing hair. Tapu Fini's main body resides inside a violet shell that resembles a swordfish head when closed. The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the \"eye\" of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines. As the guardian of Poni Island, Tapu Fini can freely manipulate water and it gains energy from ocean currents. Tapu Fini is both respected and feared. To avoid harm to itself in battle, it shrouds its surroundings in a mysterious fog that sends its opponents into a self-destructive trance. The guardian also unleashes this fog as a test for those who seek the special water it can create, which is said to cleanse anything unclean that it touches. Many humans have attempted this trial, including those with ill intent; disgusted by this history, Tapu Fini does not care much for humans. Despite this, it is willing to help those who prove themselves worthy. As seen in Run, Heroes, Run! , Tapu Fini has shown to be able to make water clocks out of water and bridge the world of the living with the world of the dead using mist.

The black space on the front contains its face, which consists of beady yellow eyes, circular blue cheeks, and a small mouth. The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half. Two wispy extensions containing starry specks serve as its arms. Cosmog's gaseous body makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. Cosmog's body is frail and easily blown away. However, it is carefree and doesn't seem to mind. It collects dust from the atmosphere, which allows it to grow slowly. Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it. Professor Mohn 's research tells that Cosmog can also open Ultra Wormholes when under extreme stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time, or even fatal when used improperly. According to Lusamine , the gases from Cosmog can also be extracted to create Ultra Wormholes. Cosmog is theorized by the Aether Foundation to be a type of Ultra Beast , and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation. In the ancient times, it was known as \u201cThe child of the stars\u201d by the people of Alola . When angered, Cosmog's wisps will puff up in a comedic way. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it. Cosmog is known to be very curious but not very cautious; this behavior has often led to Cosmog willingly put itself in danger, only to teleport away should things get dicey.

He was also the one who coined Nihilego's name. Nihilego live in another world named Ultra Deep Sea . Although its exact levels of intelligence are unknown, it is believed to act upon a self-preservation instinct . However, in addition to its human-like shape, it is sometimes seen acting like a young girl. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Nihilego's most distinctive feature is its parasitic capability. When Nihilego latches on to a host's head, it does not manipulate its actions directly. Instead it awakens the host's own capabilities and boosts them to an extreme extent in order to protect itself. It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to achieve this effect. This neurotoxin of Nihilego's is incredibly stimulating and inspires feelings of extreme excitement and a lack of inhibition in its host. Anything or anyone that Nihilego latches on to will have its native skills forcibly activated to their fullest extent and will then act as it naturally desires to. Pok\u00e9mon Adventures also elaborates upon Nihilego's neurotoxin, explaining that its venom turns their negative emotions into happiness and pleasure. It's also said that Nihilego mostly feed on those who feel intense worry or anxiety. Wicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Nihilego stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . As seen in the games and in The Homecoming Crown! , Nihilego are capable of creating illusions, such as making itself and its allies vanish and are even capable of seeing the memories of humans. That same episode also showed that Nihilego can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people. Spoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details. Nihilego merged with Lusamine Nihilego is capable of physically merging with its host, such as with Lusamine in various media. In this \"merged\" state, the Nihilego's bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine. Lusamine's body also changes and is visible within Nihilego's bell as her legs dangle beneath it. Her hair turns black with golden lines, her eyes turn yellow, half of her legs and dress become black as the other half becomes purple. The toxins produced by Nihilego may remain in the host's body, even after Nihilego has left their body. This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. Nihilego leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of Nihilego's toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body. As depicted in 10,000,000 Reasons to Fight! , its lower tentacles inject its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the same episode shows that Nihilego can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically. The same episode also shows that Nihilego can take full control of the fusion and form an orb with its own mass to prevent its host from escaping the fusion. Nihilego preys on both human and Pok\u00e9mon Both Nihilego and Lusamine's bodies look different while fused Nihilego taking over its fusion with Lusamine and trapping her inside it Spoilers end here. \u2191 Ultra Beasts Threaten Alola, pokemon-sunmoon.com, archived August 28th, 2017 \u2191 Wicke , Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon : \"When the UBs pass through the Ultra Wormhole, they are bathed in a great deal of this energy and likely store it within their bodies.\""

Protruding from under these joints is a long, silver proboscis. It has many bulging muscles that appear to be sacs full of a red fluid with small white bubbles inside. There are three sacs on each arm, two on each leg, two on its chest, and several on its shoulders and down its back. Around its waist are three rings of smaller sacs. The muscles on its chest and some on its arms and waist have thin, grayish lines resembling tendons running across them. It has large, five-fingered hands with red knuckles and four pointed legs. There are several black spikes on its body: a small one on each side of its head, two on each shoulder, one on each elbow, and one on each leg. The portions of its body between its muscles are dark red or black. On its back are two pairs of pale orange wings with slightly darker veins. Buzzwole live in another world named Ultra Jungle . Its proboscis is said to be harder than a diamond. Buzzwole is powerful enough destroy to a dump truck with a single punch. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Buzzwole's most distinctive feature is its skill to strengthen itself. Buzzwole is able to absorb energy and then achieve a chemical reaction between the energy it has absorbed and its own body fluids.\nAs a result, Buzzwole's body swells to an almost explosive extent. Its muscles bulge and are so thick and dense that they are stronger even than steel. Both its Attack and Defense experience a clear leap in power. It also displays a habit of striking a pose each time that it takes any sort of action, it is thought this might serve as a method of communication, but it is not well understood.

There is a gold ovoid inside of the widest disc, where its long, thin neck protrudes from. Its arms and legs are also long and thin with gold joints. Its hands and feet are both composed of two golden claws. Pheromosa has a small, semi-flattened head with a yellow, crown-like structure on top. The two tallest points of the crown point to its long, thin antennae, which are white with small gold balls at the tips. Attached to the back of its head are two structures resembling insect wings. The wings are transparent, curve slightly inward, and reach nearly to the ground. It has narrow, purple eyes with bright blue pupils. Pheromosa live in another world named Ultra Desert . Pheromosa's speed is believed to be fast enough to dodge lightning. It displays a considerable reluctance towards touching anything as if it interprets the Pok\u00e9mon world as being unclean somehow. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Pheromosa can reach speeds exceeding 120 mph [200 km/h] in just an instant. This speed is greater than any other living creature that has been discovered to date.

Below its head is a mass of black cables for its torso and limbs; there are white bands resembling zip ties throughout its body as well. Its arms have ties where its shoulders, elbows, and wrists would be. The upper arms have two cables, while the lower have three. At the ends of its arms are copper structures that resemble hands, each with six flat \"fingers\". The legs have ties at the hips, knees, and ankles and are composed of four cables fused together for the whole length. The feet have four toes possessing \"claws\" of exposed copper; each foot has two fused toes pointing forward and two separate toes pointing backward. Finally, its tail has three ties and four cables, one of them loose in two sections. The tail ends in what resembles a three-pronged plug. Xurkitree live in another world named Ultra Plant . There, many have been seen unmoving, with their arms and legs stuck to the ground, similar to trees as they absorb electricity from the ground. Xurkitree vary greatly in size, from being a little bigger than a human to being the size of a mountain. Because this Ultra Beast reportedly raided a power plant, it is speculated to sustain itself with electricity. Witnesses claim that its entire body crackles with astonishing electrical power. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Xurkitree's most distinctive feature is an organ that can generate power. This UB's bodily makeup is highly reminiscent of electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct electricity with great efficiency. It can discharge as much as a million volts of power at a time. When it begins to run out of power, it stabs its legs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike state as it absorbs electricity from the ground.

It has a small, white head with a tiny mouth and a skinny neck with three segments. On top of its head is a gray structure resembling a hat with long, flowing hair underneath. The hair reaches midway down its body and is rimmed with bright blue. The \"hat\" has two small blue dots and four white spikes arranged in an X-shape. These spikes resemble decorative hair sticks . On the very top of its hat is a long gray horn similar to a drill bit . It has large, disembodied gray arms that resemble bamboo stalks. At the end of each arm is a ring of bright blue, fin-like projections and a collection of eight smaller, black bamboo shoots. Each smaller stalk has a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk. Its main body is conical and resembles a dress with four overlapping layers. The shortest and outermost layer is the shortest and appears metallic, while the inner layers are each a lighter shade of green, progressively longer, and seem to be cloth or plant material. Underneath all the layers is a white body with a light gray crisscross pattern covering it and a bright blue ring along the base. Below the dress is what appears to be a collection of eight black bamboo stalks. On the bottom of each stalk is a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk; this causes the stalks to also resemble solid rocket boosters . Celesteela is one of the heaviest Pok\u00e9mon , tying with Cosmoem . Celesteela live in another world named Ultra Crater . It appears to grow out of the ground like a plant in its homeworld, before exploding the ground around itself and flying away into space for unknown reasons. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Celesteela's most distinctive feature is the energy that it stores within itself, a flammable gas that it can shoot from its two huge arms and bottom.\nThis is mostly used to propel itself in flight and for battle, but it has sufficient power and lift to even fly into space. Its bodily construction closely resembles that of a plant, specially bamboo, even being capable of absorbing nutrients from the soil. Wicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Celesteela stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . Celesteela's rocket thrusters are powerful enough to destroy an entire bamboo forest. As seen in Rise and Shine, Starship! , Celesteela have a long lifespans, as one was buried in Alola , growing for over 200 years. According to the legend \"The Celestial Starship\", told in that same episode, a mysterious object fell from the sky and was discovered by an old couple to be a large bamboo shoot, which greatly resembled an infant version of Celesteela, being later named Celeste by the couple. The couple cared for it, but due to it absorbing the nutrients of the plants around itself, the other villagers tried attacking it, but Celeste transformed and flew away into space. According to Wicke, Celesteela was named after the legend of Celeste. \u2191 Wicke , Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon : \"When the UBs pass through the Ultra Wormhole, they are bathed in a great deal of this energy and likely store it within their bodies.\""

Kartana's light, thin build makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. Kartana live in another world named Ultra Forest . According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Kartana's most distinctive feature is its thin and razor-sharp body, of which every edge has as cruel a cutting edge as any well-honed blade. The edges on its arms are particularly in a class of their own. Any opponent who tries to attack it will be cut down with a single strike of its blades. Its thin body also allows it to evade attacks by dancing lightly out of the way. This is a very dangerous creature, considering its excellent offensive and defensive capabilities, but due to the nature of its body, it is also highly vulnerable to fire and moisture.

Its main body is primarily spherical with a large, yellow mouth in the center. The top and bottom of the mouth are lined with two rows of teeth; the front row is yellow, while the rear row is black. In the second row of the upper jaw, two teeth curve out of the mouth similar to tusks . The inside of its mouth is a bright blue and its throat is lined with small spikes; its large black tongue is also lined with small spikes. Additional tongues resembling long arms with pincers protrude from its lower jaw even when its mouth is closed. Just above its mouth are two glowing, blue eyes with a yellow, diamond-shaped marking between them. Above each eye is a single, bat-like wing with yellow along the upper edge. There are other small bat-like wings down the sides of its body as well. On the underside of its body are three, fin-like projections that curve up towards its mouth. Guzzlord's body is supported by a pair of thick legs, which have yellow zigzag markings across the knees and three claws each. On top of its body is a small, conical head with a second, smaller pair of glowing blue eyes. Four short horns with yellow tips form a ring around its head. On either side of its head is a larger, slightly curved horn also tipped in yellow. There is also a pair of arms on top of its body. Each arm has a hand with three yellow claws. A row of small spikes trails down its back and along its tail. The tail itself extends from the center of its back and resembles a medieval mace . Guzzlord live in another world known as the Ultra Ruin , which is an alternate universe's Alola , more specifically Hau'oli City . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Battling the Beast Within! , it was revealed that Guzzlord is not native to the Ultra Ruin; it actually got there through an Ultra Wormhole and started devouring everything, leaving a barren wasteland behind. In the same episode, it was revealed that the second face above its maw is Guzzlord's weak point. Its body is said to feel like hard rubber. In order to eat, its tongue moves in a wave-like motion that pulls food towards its mouth. Guzzlord has an astounding appetite, devouring not only objects, but the ground, rivers, and even the seas. There have been reports of it eating mountains and buildings whole. Despite the massive amounts that it consumes, no droppings have been found, which may suggest its digestion is perfect, converting everything into energy in order to sustain itself . According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Guzzlord's most distinctive feature is its limitless appetite. It feeds without pause every moment that it is awake. It uses the two large tongues that protrude from its mouth to catch and devour everything in its path, be it organic or inorganic matter. And while it eats such an inordinate amount, Guzzlord excreta has never been discovered. It is thought that it might fully convert the things that it eats into energy for it to use.

        "name": "Necrozma",
        "bio": "Biology [ edit | edit source ] Necrozma's face is actually its brain prism Necrozma is a vaguely humanoid Pok\u00e9mon whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. Necrozma's body is primarily prismatic and black due to the amount of impurities in its system. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a eight-pointed star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the \"brain prism\", which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white. Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each. Necrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes . This causes many to believe Necrozma is one of the Ultra Beasts, however, different accounts refer to Necrozma as a \"reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts\" and \"a creature almost like an Ultra Beast\". It once had the ability to give light in its original form, but lost this ability along its true form after being heavily injured by the Ultra Recon Squad 's ancestors in an attempt to steal its light; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones and the Z-Crystals used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon being injured and rained down into Alola . According to the Ultra Recon Squad, the light that radiates from Necrozma is the aura that surrounds the Trainer and Pok\u00e9mon while performing a Z-Move and the aura surrounding a Totem Pok\u00e9mon . This energy is consumed by Pok\u00e9mon such as the Ultra Beasts and radiated by Pok\u00e9mon such as Solgaleo and Lunala . Necrozma displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state. Desperate for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, Necrozma steals light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as and known as a \"pillager of light\" in ancient times. Its black coloration is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. Necrozma can shoot powerful lasers using the power of a prism . These lasers are powerful enough to blast through anything it hits. It can also attack its foes with a large pillar of light . Using its tail, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light from it. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned as seen temporarily in Alola and in Ultra Megalopolis . In Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon , the Aether Foundation confused Necrozma for an Ultra Beast and gave it a code name, \"UB: Black\". As seen in Filling the Light with Darkness , Necrozma is capable of absorbing a world's Ultra Aura , which causes adults to become more tired and lose motivation. Necrozma loves Necrozma Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered and roared loudly to intimidate it in the past. Necrozma is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Prism Armor as an Ability. Forms [ edit | edit source ] Necrozma has three additional forms: Dusk Mane Necrozma, Dawn Wings Necrozma, and Ultra Necrozma. Necrozma can take control of Solgaleo or Lunala by fusing with them, dominating their bodies and eclipsing their minds to assume its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings forms, respectively. However, Necrozma is also able to coexist with its host willingly, regardless of fusion . Because Necrozma is forcibly absorbing their limitless light energy, Solgaleo and Lunala constantly glow while fused like in their Radiant Sun and Full Moon Phases. In both cases, the host's body is covered in pieces of Necrozma's body, which are arranged like armor, and Necrozma wields powers that exceed its respective host; it's powerful enough to open multiple Ultra Wormholes at once across a large area. When fused to either Solgaleo or Lunala, Necrozma becomes uncontrollably vicious and constantly rampages, treating anything it sees as an enemy and brutally attacking them with either its claws or its lasers, which can cut through anything. The main reason is due the respective Legendary Pok\u00e9mon's limitless energy being much more excessive than what Necrozma needs. Necrozma is capable of fusing with Solgaleo and Lunala without the need for N-Solarizer or N-Lunarizer , supposedly due to both Legendary Pok\u00e9mon radiating the same aura it feeds on. Dusk Mane Necrozma Solgaleo taken over by Necrozma Dusk Mane Necrozma resembles an armored Solgaleo with Necrozma as body armor. Dusk Mane Necrozma has armor around its paws, head, and sides. Necrozma's tail splits into two and attaches to the sides of Solgaleo's torso and its large claws extend from Solgaleo's back. The front feet have five black claws attached to them with two V-shaped crystals on top of it while the back foot has only three claws. It has a triangular helmet with a long, thin antenna on each side and Necrozma's brain prism is prominently displayed. Solgaleo's own eyes and nose are visible as bright, blue lights. The host's tail gains three black spikes attached to each other, as well as three spikes under the chin. A structure similar to one of Necrozma's legs extends from its back. As Dusk Mane Necrozma, Necrozma takes over Solgaleo's body and mind. Dusk Mane Necrozma is said be more powerful than Solgaleo. It can use the six powered-up claws on its four legs and back to pounce on on foes. Dusk Mane Necrozma uses these six claws to deal slicing damage onto the opponent. Using the armor on its chest, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light. It uses Solgaleo's limitless energy energy to both feed it energy and fuel its endless rampage. Dusk Mane Necrozma and Solgaleo are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Sunsteel Strike . They are also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Searing Sunraze Smash . Dawn Wings Necrozma Lunala taken over by Necrozma Dawn Wings Necrozma resembles an armored Lunala with Necrozma as body armor. Dawn Wings Necrozma has armor around its torso, head, and certain parts of its wings and tail. It also has a triangular helmet with the brain prism visible, as well as Lunala's own eyes visible as glowing pink lights. Necrozma's arms extend from the center of its chest. The armor surrounding its body has two large spikes jutting up from around its shoulders and four, glowing pink lights in the center. On its lower back are two thin, antennae-like growths extending downward. A structure similar to Necrozma's tail extends from the center of its back, and like its Dusk Mane form, can be used as a form of propulsion. There are eleven crystalline spikes attached around the body, four each on the wings, and three on Lunala's tail. Dawn Wings Necrozma is a fusion of Necrozma and Lunala, leaving Lunala with no will of its own. Dawn Wings Necrozma is said to be more powerful than Lunala. These spines are capable of firing dark energy. Dawn Wings Necrozma uses this dark energy to  quickly reach and attack enemies in a furious rush. It uses Lunala's limitless energy energy to both feed it energy and fuel its endless rampage. Dawn Wings Necrozma and Lunala are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Moongeist Beam . They are also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom . Ultra Necrozma Ultra Necrozma firing laser beams from every part of its body When Necrozma absorbs overwhelming amounts of light energy and Z-Power , it undergoes Ultra Burst , which causes it to split apart and then reform into its true form, Ultra Necrozma. It can achieve this by taking control of a Solgaleo or a Lunala while holding an Ultranecrozium Z . Alternatively, it can transform into Ultra Necrozma by absorbing Z-Power directly from Z-Moves (as seen in Securing the Future! ) or by absorbing the Ultranecrozium Z (as seen in Transcend!! Ultra Necrozma! ). Ultra Necrozma is a colossal dragon Pok\u00e9mon, composed mostly of pure light energy that it had stored from a great energy source before its transformation. This body of light is supported by a sort of skeleton made from the various pieces of Necrozma's crystalline body; these pieces take on a golden glow from the light, but they return to black without it. Its sheer size makes it the tallest known Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon. Its head is surrounded by several spikes and a pair of small wings, which causes it to resemble an eight-pointed star; there is also a small, lighter eight-pointed star on the back of its head. Its face is armored and has multicolored heterochromic eyes; the left eye is primarily red, while the right is mainly blue. The patterns around its eyes resemble the Ultranecrozium Z. It has two pairs of wings: one around its shoulders and one around its hips. While the wings themselves are made of light, the arm portions are made of its former legs and shoulders, respectively. Its former arms now cover its lower legs, and what was once its tail covers its chest. Finally, it has a long tail with a row of spikes along the top. Necrozma is at its full power in this form, radiating energy that has all sorts of effects on living beings and even nature itself. Its body temperature exceeds 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,540 degrees Celsius); anything that it touches will melt from the extreme heat. It can fire laser beams from every part of its body, and these lasers can reach over 18 miles away, burning through everything in their path. While swinging its four wings around, Ultra Necrozma uses its superheated claws to tear its opponents to shreds. In this form, it is known as the \"blinding one\" due to its brilliant appearance. As seen in The Prism Between Light and Darkness! , when Ultra Necrozma uses up all its light, it reverts to its lightless form and enters into a deep slumber unless it absorbs more light. Ultra Necrozma is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Light That Burns the Sky . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Neuroforce as an Ability .

Magearna is a metallic, bipedal, and artificial Pok\u00e9mon that is made up primarily of spheres. Its head is a medium-sized sphere with a slight point in the back. Around Magearna's head is a gear with seven teeth, although the gear does not cover its chin. It has two large, rabbit-like ears with gold rims; a tiny nose and mouth; and light red eyes with pinkish ovals in the center. In the centers of the ovals are white crosses, and thin gold wiring encircles each eye with two small prongs similar to eyelashes. The rabbit-like ears appear to be two halves of a large disc held together by a hinge at the top. In the center of Magearna's body, there lies an orb-shaped object called the \"Soul-Heart\", which is Magearna's true self. The Soul-Heart is mostly light blue, but is divided by a thick gray band, and in the front center of the band lies a circular depression that is half-blue and half-pink. Above and below the depression, in the light blue portions, is a yellow, diamond-shaped marking. On either side of its upper body is a large, spherical shoulder with thin upper arms that lead to large, claw-shaped forearms and slightly pointed hands. Its lower body is a much larger sphere that resembles a ball gown . There is a pair of golden, wavy lines on each side of this sphere, which is divided down the front and back by a gray line. In the back, there is a solid gold ring with a hole in the center at the bottom of this line. The front has a gold ring as well, but it is broken at the top and bottom and has a shield shape in the center. Metal plates similar to the ruffles of a dress adorn the bottom of its lower body. It has two pointed legs. Magearna was created by a scientist as a gift to royalty, specifically to a king's daughter 500 years ago. In Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel , the scientist who created Magearna was a man named Nikola and the king's daughter who received it was an unnamed princess of the Azoth Kingdom . The Soul-Heart in its chest is an artificial soul that was created by the scientist by collecting life energy from other Pok\u00e9mon. Due to Magearna's ability to feel other's pain, it will try as hard as it can to save injured Pok\u00e9mon.  It can even perceive the emotions, thoughts, or feelings of other Pok\u00e9mon as well. When it falls asleep or when it is sad, Magearna can take on the appearance of a Pok\u00e9 Ball . . Magearna is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fleur Cannon . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Soul-Heart as an Ability . Forms [ edit | edit source ] Magearna has a separate form known as Original Color Magearna. Original Color Magearna Original Color Magearna's upper body and legs were mostly painted gold instead of silver, with the exception of the gear around its head, which remained silver. Its ears and the top half of its lower body were painted red,  while the bottom half remained white, matching the coloration of an ordinary Pok\u00e9 Ball . This is the coloration Magearna had back when it was created. Its vivid coloring made the king's daughter very pleased with the gift. As years went by, the paint on Magearna's body decomposed, which is its standard appearance, where most of its body is silver.
